"says cocaine is available, they say, ‘I’m going to stay over here and I’m going to take the banana pellet,’ ” Nader tells me. “That’s what I want.” Our version of a banana pellet is perhaps more likely to be a healthy green salad, but the idea is the same. Nader’s studies raise an intriguing possibility. If the chemical cocktail within the brains of monkeys changes when they gain power and dominance, it would be surprising if we—their primate cousins—don’t develop biological changes when we gain control over others. The monkey cocaine studies seem to point to a simple conclusion: that power is good for our bodies. It makes us more resilient. Is that true? The answer isn’t so simple. Biological Stress Is Bad, Control Is Good How do rank, power, status, and physical health fit together? How can we be sure that those factors are the cause of biological changes in our physical well-being rather than coincidence? Those are two of the questions that Professor Sir Michael Marmot of University College London has dedicated much of his life to answering. In most observational studies (studies that look at data from the real world rather than through a carefully controlled experiment in a lab), it’s difficult to disentangle cause and effect. If you just compared, say, CEOs to custodians, you’d certainly find big differences in health outcomes. But the two groups have so many other differences that any relationships you found between status and health could’ve been caused by hundreds of different variables: education, childhood experience, nutrition, you name it. It would be impossible to show that status, or climbing the hierarchy, had altered anyone’s biology. Whenever Marmot suggested power and health were related, most people chalked it up to one of two things: stress or money. Either people who were powerful would have worse health outcomes because they were stressed, or they’d have better health outcomes because they were rich. In 1985, Marmot decided to test those"
