"Exponential: How Accelerating Technology Is Leaving Us Behind and What to Do About It" is a book by Azeem Azhar published in 2021. The book discusses how technology is rapidly advancing and leaving people behind, and what can be done about it. The preface of the book describes the transformation of the author's suburban neighborhood in north-west London from farmland to a developed area in just a few years.

The emergence of modern life in London during the interwar era reflects the sudden technological transformation that occurred in the early twentieth century. The adoption of key technologies such as cars, electricity, and telephones brought about significant social upheaval, including changes in employment and transport. Humans have always been technologists and have used technology to redefine their world, allowing them to farm, travel, and move from nomadic to urban life.

Technology can have enormous, unpredictable effects on all areas of human life, including politics and culture. Complexity science studies the interactions between the countless elements of a complex system such as human society, where small changes can cause sudden and profound repercussions across the whole system. Feedback loops or ripples can feel uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing, as seen in the apprehension around new technologies like elevators, telephones, and television a century ago.

The fear of technological change is not new, as it often leads to transformation of multiple spheres. Today, technological advancements are occurring at an unprecedented pace with innovations like computing, AI, renewable energy, and biology changing rapidly and exponentially. More than 60% of people surveyed worldwide feel uncomfortable with how fast technology is moving. These new technologies are impacting all aspects of society, leading to new services and changes in the economy and social interactions.

The book focuses on the transformative impact of new technology, which is getting faster and changing the relationships between companies, employers, workers, and citizens. The author explains that societies can undergo phase changes, similar to liquid water turning into steam. The transformation of society in the early twenty-first century is due to the acceleration of technological change, which is having an impact on politics, economies, and ways of life. The book is not pessimistic, and the author believes in human adaptability to thrive in the face of technological change. However, there is a lack of vocabulary and misunderstandings in the public conversation about technology, which the book aims to address.

The text argues against the common misconception that technology is neutral and independent of human biases and power structures. It points out that technology is built by people who direct and design it according to their own preferences, and thus, it is not value-free. Society may need to regulate the technologists and their creations to manage any encoded ideology or system of power.

The text argues that technology reflects human desires and can perpetuate existing systems of power. Politicians' lack of understanding of technology is a problem, as effective analysis of technology involves straddling two worlds. The book examines how technology interacts with social, political, and economic organization, and argues for a more informed and nuanced approach to technology.

The gap between the culture of technology and the world of humanities and social science is wider than ever before, making it difficult for leading thinkers on both sides to offer the right solutions. The author aims to bring these two worlds together by helping technologists view their efforts in a wider social context and helping non-technologists understand the technologies underpinning this period of rapid social change. The author's background in the tech industry and experience founding companies and investing in start-ups gives them a unique perspective on this issue.

The author has a background in both venture capitalism and social sciences. They invest in young technology companies and have spoken with hundreds of technology founders in diverse fields. They have explained complicated technology topics to a mainstream audience and have focused on the political implications of new forms of technology. They are a board member of the Ada Lovelace Institute, which explores the ethical implications of data and artificial intelligence in society. The author founded Exponential View, a newsletter and podcast that explores the impact of new technology on society and addresses ethical dilemmas related to public data.

The author's Exponential newsletter has 200,000 subscribers worldwide and a podcast series with over 100 interviews on the topic of new technology. The author has done extensive research and concludes that new technologies are advancing exponentially while institutions and social norms change incrementally, resulting in an exponential gap. The impact of these technologies in various spheres raises questions about their sustainability and what individuals can do to adapt.

The book explains how new general purpose technologies are advancing at an exponential rate, leading to the emergence of the Exponential Age and an exponential gap between technology and social institutions. The book explores the implications of this gap in various spheres, including the economy, work, geopolitics, and society, and discusses the challenges and opportunities it presents for policymakers, business leaders, and citizens. The book highlights winner-takes-all markets and changing prospects for employees as technology-driven companies become bigger, while traditional companies get left behind.

The relationships between workers and employers are changing rapidly due to the rise of gig platforms and new styles of work. Existing laws and employment practices struggle to cope with these changes. The Exponential Age is transforming geopolitics by rewiring trade, conflict, and the global balance of power. This transformation involves a shift towards re-localization and a transformation of warfare, with new adversarial tactics emerging. The rise of state-sized companies is challenging assumptions about the role of private corporations and markets are expanding into the public sphere and private lives. National conversations are increasingly conducted on privately owned platforms, and intimate details about individuals are bought and sold online.

Technology is rapidly changing our society, turning various aspects of our lives into commodities and creating an exponential gap that challenges our cherished values. The book provides a guide on how to thrive in an age of exponential change by making institutions more resilient, emphasizing collective ownership and decision-making, and more. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the difficulty of controlling exponential growth and the limitations of technology in solving ancient problems.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the power of technology, including fast internet, smartphones, and machine learning, which enabled lockdowns and the rapid development of vaccines. The pandemic also demonstrated that technology is now embedded in every part of our lives, blurring the lines between technology and politics, economics, culture, and society. Predicting the future is difficult due to the constant feedback loop between technology and other spheres. Nonetheless, this book provides an introduction to where new technology is taking us, in an era of exponential change that undermines the stability of many aspects of our lives.

The book acknowledges that there is no perfect roadmap to the future we want, but hopes to reveal the terrain and point us in the right direction. The author reflects on his first encounter with a computer in 1979 and how, despite a primordial global supply chain, the first signs of the digital revolution were already visible. He received his own computer in 1981, a Sinclair ZX81, which was small and light, with an unforgiving keyboard. Despite this, he was able to program and get a lot out of it.

The article describes the author's experience of owning and upgrading computers in the UK from the ZX81, which was a breakthrough device with simple programming language, to the Acorn BBC Master, a more sophisticated computer with faster processing and more memory. The author later upgraded again in the early 1990s during a period of consolidation in the computer industry, which saw the emergence of Microsoft and Intel as dominant players.

The article describes the symbiotic relationship between Intel and Microsoft, where Intel delivered more computational power while Microsoft used it to deliver better software, and how this led to the author buying a PC clone with the latest Intel processor and Microsoft's operating system. The PC clone had 4 megabytes of memory and impressive graphics but crashed frequently when the turbo button was used. This journey reflected a period of exponential improvement in computer technology over 10 years.

The progress in the computing industry has led to a transformation of computers from being cumbersome machines with dozens of mechanical parts to powerful electronic devices that utilize binary logic represented by 1s and 0s. Claude Shannon's discovery of electronic circuits utilizing Boolean logic paved the way for the development of electronic components, and the invention of the transistor allowed for the creation of logic gates that could perform elementary logic. These advancements led to the doubling of computer speed every couple of years, resulting in millions of times more capable computers in the span of a decade.

The invention of the transistor in 1947 paved the way for smaller and more reliable electronic components, and the development of the integrated circuit by Robert Noyce in 1960 allowed for several transistors to be combined into a single component through photolithography. Gordon Moore realized that the physical area of integrated circuits was reducing by about 50% every year, resulting in smaller components, improved performance, and reduced costs. This led to the production of more intricate components and the continuous improvement of computer technology.

In 1965, Gordon Moore postulated that advancements in chip technology would double their speed every 18-24 months for the same cost, which became known as Moore's Law. This law is descriptive, not predictive, and was adopted as an objective by the computer industry. Despite not being a law of physics, Moore's Law has been a good guide to the progress of computer technology, with chips getting more powerful and following an exponential curve of growth.

The number of transistors per chip multiplied almost 10 million times between 1971 and 2015 due to advancements in chip technology, and the cost of a single transistor dropped significantly. This led to an astonishing rate of improvement in computer processing speed and made computers more affordable, driving the computing revolution. The number of computers has since increased dramatically, making them commonplace in everyday life.

There are over 5 billion computing devices in use that are rapidly becoming outdated due to exponential growth in digital technology. Exponential growth refers to a compounding increase over time, and this growth is the defining force of our age. Exponential technologies can improve at a rate of more than 10% per year for several decades, and their emergence is a recent development.

A compounding improvement of 10% per year in the price and performance of a technology would result in it becoming more than 2.5 times more powerful for the same price every 10 years, and the cost would drop by more than three-fifths for the same level of performance. This change should hold true for decades for a technology to be considered exponential. The diesel engine is not an exponential technology, while the computer chip business qualifies. Many technologies discussed in the book improve at rates of 20 to 50% or more per year, leading to significant capability increases for the same price over a decade.



 Decreases in technology prices lead to their widespread adoption and integration into new products. 

 Exponential technological development leads to cheaper products that can perform new functions. 

 Business analyst Horace Dediu's research shows the historical patterns of innovation and the speed of technology spread through the American economy. 

 Dediu tracked more than 200 years of data on innovations such as flush toilets, electrification of printing, ATM machines, social media, and computer tablets. 

 He established how long it took for each innovation to reach 75% penetration in the American market.



 The spread of most technologies follows an S-curve, starting slowly and accelerating rapidly before tapering off as the market becomes saturated. 

 The point of market saturation may be more distant than expected, as seen with the widespread adoption of computers in households. 

 The S-curve model remains accurate, but with exponential technologies, the acceleration up the S-curve can be astonishingly fast. 

 The process of market saturation has been getting faster for decades, leading to an increasing rate of change.

The pace of technological advancement has accelerated dramatically, with digital technologies spreading much faster than their earlier counterparts. While earlier technologies like cars, telephones, and electricity took over 30 years to reach three-quarters of American households, today's exponential technologies powered by computing infrastructure reach the same level of saturation within 8-15 years. The diffusion of digital technology is continually increasing, with social media taking just 14% of a lifespan to achieve saturation, while electricity took 62% of the average lifespan at the time of introduction.

The exponential spread of technology has accelerated dramatically, with digital technologies spreading much faster than earlier counterparts. Social media platforms like Facebook grew at unprecedented speed, amassing millions of users within a short period of time. Similarly, Lime, a bike-sharing company, took only six months to serve one million rides after its launch in 2017. The revolution in computing has enabled such rapid growth, making it possible for Lime to put small computers and GSM radios in every bike. Even companies in other countries like Korea are experiencing similar levels of growth, with KakaoTalk launching a bank that attracted 2 million users within two weeks.

The exponential growth of digital technology is due to Moore's Law which allows for constant increases in computing power at decreasing costs. This has led to the rapid success of products like smartphones and social media apps such as TikTok. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of this growth as chip design approaches its limits.

The semiconductor industry has heavily invested in meeting Moore's Law, which has led to the use of sophisticated laser technology and extremely clean manufacturing facilities. However, the growth of transistors per chip has slowed due to overheating and potential quantum physics issues, posing a challenge for chip engineers. Despite this, the growth of computing power is not expected to decelerate.

Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns explains why technology develops at an accelerating pace, as different technologies interact and layer on top of one another. This process creates multiple S-curves, with one technology approaching its explosive phase of acceleration as another flattens out. Kurzweil's focus is on how technologies interact, rather than individual inventions or sectors of the economy.

According to Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns, different technologies nourish one another, inspiring developments in the next sector and leading to a quickening in the pace of technological progression. This has implications for the future of computing, as increased computing power might not be based on cramming more transistors onto a chip. Artificial intelligence (AI) has broken through the limits of chip design and has become a new technical paradigm. AI is considered intelligent if it can take actions that achieve its objectives and make decisions. Researchers have been working on building intelligent machines for the past 60 years.

AI progress was slow due to lack of data and computing power, with machine learning seen as the likely breakthrough. However, until the early 2010s, there wasn't enough data available. Fei-Fei Li created ImageNet, a project that collected over 14 million annotated images, which single-handedly catalyzed the explosion of useful AI. This helped machine learning algorithms to identify recurrent patterns, and AI researchers started to make significant progress.

ImageNet provided high-quality labelled data that led to an explosion in computing power and the development of deep learning. In 2012, AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network with extraordinary computing power, won the ImageNet competition, proving that deep learning works. This sparked an AI feeding frenzy, with scientists rushing to build AI systems and investors backing inventors. As a result, neural networks required increasing amounts of data and processing power.

The exponential growth of computational power used to train AI models has far exceeded Moore's Law, with an increase of 300,000 times between 2012 and 2018. This was made possible by using specialized chips developed for high-end graphics in video games, which were surprisingly well suited for performing the complex mathematical calculations required for AI. As a result, the computer industry has risen to the challenge of building specialized chips for running neural networks at high speeds.

AI chips have exceeded the limitations of Moore's Law by using larger components rather than miniaturization. This means that computing power is expected to continue growing exponentially, and if necessary, quantum computing could provide a completely novel approach. Quantum computers can solve complex problems, such as modeling new molecules, in a fraction of the time it would take a classical computer. In one experiment, a prototype quantum computer from Google completed a computing test in 200 seconds, which would have taken a classical supercomputer around 10,000 years.

- A primordial quantum computer is over a billion times faster than its classical rival, proving Kurzweil's theory of new technological paradigms replacing old ones. - Computing was the first technology to exhibit exponential change, creating new industries and accelerating technological development. - The acceleration of technology is driven by a mix of social, economic, and political forces. - The wider process of acceleration and its causes are explored.

- The movie "The Man with the Golden Gun" reflected the world's anxieties during the 1973 oil crisis and showcased a futuristic solar power plant. - Alternative energy sources, such as solar power, captured the world's imagination but were too expensive to be practical at the time. - The cost of photovoltaics has since dropped significantly, making solar power a more viable energy source.

The cost of solar power has decreased significantly in the last decade, with the price of electricity generated by solar power declining by 89% in the decade up to 2019. Solar power has become the cheapest source of electricity in two-thirds of the world, and its use has transformed the lives of people in various regions. Exponentiality is not limited to computing, but is widespread in energy, biology, and manufacturing, with the costs of key technologies in each area falling dramatically by a factor of six or more every decade.

The exponential change is not limited to computing but is also observed in energy, biology, and manufacturing. Growing demand has pushed the price of technology ever lower, and every new innovation interacts and combines with others to create new technological possibilities. In the Exponential Age, energy sources like wind power are also becoming increasingly cheaper, leading to the displacement of other forms of energy production. The cost of generating electricity from wind turbines declined by 70% in the decade up to 2019, helping to displace fossil fuel power stations.

Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power face limitations in their intermittency and lack of storage, but the cost of lithium-ion batteries has been decreasing rapidly, making large-scale battery systems nearly cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels. The price of electricity generated by renewables and battery storage is expected to continue declining in the next decade. In the field of biology, technological progress in biomatter is outpacing that of energy, and reading the human genome is a complex process that requires breaking it into millions of small pieces to be read using electrochemical arrays.

The cost of decoding the human genome has decreased rapidly, from $500 million to $942 in 2019, with a 100,000-fold improvement in less than 20 years. The Shenzhen-based company BGI announced in 2020 that it could sequence a full genome for only $100, representing a million-fold improvement. Lower prices have resulted in higher usage, with humanity sequencing more than 200,000 genomes a year in 2015, and an estimated 2 billion human genomes to be sequenced by 2025. The decrease in cost is due to factors such as growing computing power and improvements in technology, surpassing the predictions of Moore's Law.

Advancements in biotechnology have made DNA sequencing cheaper and easier with developments in reagents, amplifiers, sensors, and robotics. Synthetic biology combines multiple disciplines to create new biological systems that can produce materials and chemicals. By 2040, 60% of the physical inputs in the global economy could be produced biologically. Manufacturing is also transforming, offering the potential for producing new materials and components in ways not previously possible.

Subtractive manufacturing, where material is chiseled away from a block, has been the dominant method for thousands of years. While casting and molding are more efficient, they can only produce copies of a single design. 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, creates objects by layering melted material in a computer-aided design process. It has improved dramatically since the mid-1980s and can now use a variety of materials, including human proteins. It allows for individual detailing without waste and has potential for organ transplants and other medical applications.

Noah Raford led the creation of a 3D-printed single-story building that used 75% less concrete than typical buildings and was built with high precision. Additive manufacturing is still a small industry but is rapidly developing, with an estimated annual growth rate of up to 37.6%. The four domains of computing, biology, energy, and manufacturing are undergoing transformational change, with additive manufacturing being a significant contributor. The impact of technologies varies, with some having limited uses, while others have more profound impacts on society.

General purpose technologies (GPTs) have broad utility and can transform society beyond recognition. GPTs create opportunities for complementary products and services and can upturn economies and societies. GPTs have effects beyond any one sector, such as the car's impact on roads, fuel stations, urban environments, and consumer practices. GPTs create an agenda for the creation of new products, processes, and organizational forms.

The emergence of transformative new waves of General Purpose Technologies (GPTs) in the four domains of computing, energy, biology, and manufacturing is revolutionizing the economy. While it is hard to pinpoint precisely what the GPTs will be, the growing computing power, gene engineering, and 3D printing are transforming these domains. The revolutionary effect of GPTs may take time to materialize as they are integrated into the economy in a series of steps, starting with the installation phase, where the basic infrastructure underpinning a GPT is developed.

The deployment phase is the stage when the economies have rolled out enough of a new technology to be useful, companies have figured out its purpose, and managers and workers have built up the requisite knowledge and experience to make use of the technology. This is a golden age in which societies can enjoy the boons of a General Purpose Technology (GPT), but it takes time to get there. However, in our age, the transformation may come faster than ever before due to the faster rate at which technologies are rolling out. Computing has transformed corporate organization, enabling the creation and processing of information, and products targeting small niches.

The rise of computers and the spread of the internet, facilitated by the smartphone, have transformed many parts of the economy and daily life, leading to a significant increase in internet users and smartphone ownership. The effects of these technologies have rippled across various aspects of our lives and are driven by GPTs, which are only beginning to emerge.

The exponential revolution is being driven by three forces, with the first being "learning by doing." This force is related to the limitations of Moore's Law, which is a social fact willed into existence by industry and human behavior, rather than a magical process. Many nascent technologies, such as cheap power, bioengineering, and 3D printing, are yet to fully impact our lives.

Wright's Law is a principle developed by Theodore Wright in the 1920s that states for every doubling of units produced, costs will fall by a constant percentage, known as the learning rate. The principle is based on the idea that as engineers build a product, they learn by doing and figure out more efficient ways to connect components, which drives rapid increases in efficiency. The key to the continuation of Wright's Law is increasing volume, which drives demand, improves the process, drives down costs, and further increases demand. Wright's Law can be applied to various industries, and it provides a better approach to predicting technological change than time-based models.

Wright's Law emphasizes the relationship between demand and skill, and it describes how the cost of technology diminishes exponentially as the quantity produced increases. It applies to various technologies and provides a better approach to predicting technological change than time-based models. The declining cost of lithium-ion batteries has been successfully predicted using Wright's Law, and it has been observed in the electric car industry, where demand for such batteries increased by a factor of 665 between 2010 and 2020, leading to a decline in the per-unit price.

Wright's Law, which describes the decrease in prices of a product with increasing production, has historically had limits due to market saturation. However, in the current economy, these limits seem more distant, and prices of new technologies like USB sticks continue to drop endlessly. The physical nature of the underlying technologies may contribute to this phenomenon. Despite this, there are examples such as the Boeing 737 where prices have increased over time.

Exponential gains in efficiency from advancements in technology like silicon chips and wind turbines are due to the square-cube law, where increasing the size of components has a greater impact on efficiency. The newfound power of Wright's Law is also attributed to the expansion of global markets, allowing for increased demand and more efficient production. The volume of world trade has increased 60-fold, contributing to the continued growth of exponential gains.

Wright's Law and combinatorial invention are driving us into an exponential future. The cycle of production leading to cheaper goods and bigger markets has an inherently exponential logic. General purpose technologies of the Exponential Age are improving at exponential rates and combining in novel and powerful ways, pioneering fresh directions for other technologies to evolve. An example of combinatorial invention is Energy Vault's huge electricity storage system using locally sourced solar power and reconstituted building rubble to store the equivalent of 35 megawatt-hours of electricity as gravitational potential energy, which can power 1,000 compact electric cars or a typical American home for more than nine years.

The giant crane-block battery depends on the interaction of four well-understood technologies and an automated machine vision system using deep learning, allowing Energy Vault to hit a competitive price. Technologies have always combined, but contemporary technologies are more prone to combination due to standardisation and modularization. Standard components can be used in different compound products, making it easier and cheaper to build more complex products. New breakthroughs rely on aspects of the technologies that went before.

Standardization facilitates the speed of bringing a product to market and scaling, building consensus around simple and complex things through international standards bodies. Important standards have been developed from the bottom up by the people creating new technologies. The internet is an example of this, built on standards created by academic researchers, including email and web protocols. These standards enable us to send emails and communicate online. However, not all products adhere to international standards, as seen with electrical sockets requiring adapters when traveling to different countries.

Standardization of technologies enables interoperability and makes the world more efficient, allowing for different innovations to combine and catalyze further innovation. Adhering to standard forms allows technologies to be applied to a wider range of industries and become like Lego blocks that can be selected and assembled into an array of services. The author's experience in trying to obtain satellite photographs of major ports in 2006 highlights the difficulty of realizing innovative ideas without standardization. However, today it is cheap and easy to obtain accurate, up-to-date photographs of almost any part of the planet, which is used by companies for various economic insights.

Satellites have become more accessible and affordable due to standardization of components. This has led to an increase in satellite launches and the emergence of new technological developments. Standardization has also become commonplace in software, allowing developers to use standard components to complete frequent tasks and combine technologies in new ways. This shift in technological development allows firms to draw on expertise from various industries.

Laura O'Sullivan developed an automated system to detect anomalies in cervical smears using machine vision technology. She learned how to build and fine-tune convolutional neural networks and how to find and clean the data through online courses. She used an open-source data set of cervical smears from Herlev Hospital in Denmark and used generative adversarial networks to create a balanced data set. Her work demonstrates the potential of machine learning to improve the detection of cervical cancer.

The proliferation of networks, including informational networks, has led to the exponential development and spread of technology. A young researcher in California was able to download and use GAN code for free from GitHub and was able to create software that outperformed a human doctor in identifying anomalies in images. The use of networks has changed the nature of trade, invention, science, relationships, disease, finance, information, threats, and more.

The creation of arXiv by Paul Ginsparg, a centralised system for downloading preprints, revolutionised the distribution of scientific knowledge and ignited the open access movement. The availability of good-quality papers widened the availability of scholarly thinking and preprint servers have removed boundaries to academic research, allowing ordinary people to access cutting-edge ideas for free and widening participation in the scientific process. Around 50 preprint services now work to accelerate the diffusion of academic knowledge.

The power of preprint servers and other online information networks in accelerating collaboration and spreading new ideas is discussed. The internet enables collaboration through various networks, including GitHub, Behance, blogs, and social networks, which catalyze the emergence of exponential technology. The shipping container also played a significant role in revolutionizing the movement of physical products by making it faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

The arrival of standardized shipping containers revolutionized the movement of physical products by reducing the cost of doing business globally. Container ships grew in size, and between 2000 and 2018, container port traffic more than tripled. These new shipping technologies combined with the internet, e-commerce, and computerized ordering systems to make logistics increasingly efficient, leading to the just-in-time supply chain where products are produced and shipped in a matter of weeks.

Trade networks, consisting of the digital and physical networks, have contributed to the development and spread of new technologies, allowing products to diffuse into far-flung markets faster than ever before. These networks, along with the power of learning by doing and the increasing interaction and combination of new technologies, are the driving forces behind exponential technologies. The process of globalization, including shifts in politics and economics, is intertwined with these driving forces.

Exponential technology and globalization are closely linked to a new political orthodoxy that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Economists began to shape public policy as Western governments adopted a more interventionist approach to their economies. The emergence of a new school of economics led by Milton Friedman advocated for a market-friendly ideology of rolling back regulations and cutting taxes to unleash the power of the market. This ideology paved the way for the return of high growth and manageable inflation.

The emergence of free-market capitalism in the late 1970s helped drive globalization and kindled the Exponential Age by unleashing the power of exponentiality. This new political orthodoxy helped lay the foundations of the transition to the Exponential Age, but it took a while to get going. It is challenging to give an actual start date for the Exponential Age.

Exponential change is a continual, smooth curve, and it is challenging to pinpoint the start of the Exponential Age. However, the tipping point at which exponential technologies began to really transform everything came in the second decade of the twenty-first century, with the emergence of smartphones, the drop in the global average cost for solar photovoltaic energy below that of coal, and the rise of large companies based on exponentially developing digital technologies such as Apple, Tencent, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook.

The Exponential Age is a time when exponential technologies and their effects are a defining force in society, driving changes at an unusually rapid rate. This disruptive power lies not only in exponential change but in the way humans respond to it. Amazon's success is a result of its huge research and development budget, which leaves many other companies and governments behind.

Amazon's success is attributed to its huge R&D budget, which outstrips that of other companies and even some governments. Amazon's exponential increase in its R&D budget created an exponential gap between traditional linear-thinking businesses and those that can harness the technologies of the new era. The exponential gap is a consequence of exponential technology, with some companies, institutions, and communities being left behind at an incremental pace.

In the Exponential Age, the cost of computation declines rapidly due to Moore's Law. Companies that understand this deflation and plan for it become well-positioned to take advantage of the trend, as futuristic activities that are expensive now will become affordable soon enough. This realization has deep significance for organizations, and firms that recognized this trend early on, such as Amazon, became some of the most valuable companies in history. Other digital giants like Uber, Alibaba, Spotify, and TikTok have also taken advantage of this trend.

Tesla, Impossible Foods, Spire, and Planet Labs are examples of companies that understood how exponential technology shifts would drive down costs and took advantage of them. Conversely, the newspaper publishing industry did not adapt and struggled. Exponential change starts off looking boring, but soon reaches an inflection point and crosses the line of linear change. This shift is hard for institutions to fathom, as they follow a linear trajectory and are built for stability. The gap between institutions' capacity to change and new technologies' accelerating speed is the defining consequence of the shift into the Exponential Age.

The Exponential Age has created a gap between rapidly advancing technologies and the norms that were designed for earlier configurations of technology, leading to tension and challenges in various domains such as the economy, nature of work, and the relationship between markets and citizens. This creates a dissonance and challenges the norms of society in areas that define everyday existences as consumers, citizens, workers, and bosses.

The exponential gap, which is the tension between rapidly advancing technologies and societal norms, is caused by humans being bad at processing rapid change. The author uses an example of exponential rain to illustrate this concept. People born in earlier generations have experienced numerous waves of innovation, and the rapid change bewilders them.

The article discusses the concept of exponential growth and how it can be difficult for humans to comprehend. It references the work of Thomas Malthus and his predictions about population growth and resource scarcity. The article also mentions the Limits to Growth report, which warned of the unsustainability of exponential patterns in resource usage. Overall, the article suggests that understanding exponential processes is important for addressing environmental challenges.

The article highlights how humans struggle to understand exponential growth and tend to underestimate the future size of something growing at a compounded rate, as demonstrated by studies in psychology and finance. The article warns that this blind spot could have significant implications for predicting the types of accelerating changes that economic activity may cause, especially for technologies improving at a compounding rate of 10% or more per annum. The article also mentions the anchoring bias and its impact on decision-making under uncertainty.

People tend to anchor their numerical expectations based on readily available numbers, but this fails when encountering exponential growth. Humans consistently underestimate the power of exponential change due to their linear mentality, which is a result of the slow pace of life throughout human history. This slow pace defined our existence until remarkably recently, making it challenging to adapt to a faster pace of life. Exceptions to this exist, such as the spread of a pandemic pathogen.

Humans evolved for a linear world and have not often dealt with dramatic continuous changes within their lifetimes. The exponential age poses a challenge for making predictions about exponential change in the real world, causing people to dismiss new products or services that show signs of hockey stick growth. For example, in the early 1980s, McKinsey estimated that the US mobile phone market would approach 900,000 subscribers by 2000, but this prediction turned out to be significantly underestimated.

The cost of mobile phones and data services decreased significantly over the years due to technological advancements and expanding networks. McKinsey wrongly predicted the number of mobile phone users in the US, and the International Energy Agency made inaccurate predictions about global solar power generation. Predicting the future is difficult, especially against an exponential curve.

The International Energy Agency made inaccurate predictions about global solar power generation for six consecutive years, both underestimating and overestimating the growth. Experts can be prone to both underestimating and overestimating exponential growth, and slight errors in assumptions can throw off predictions. Mimicking the complexity of the human brain with a machine is a big if, as there are many uncertainties about the brain's function and structure.

Predicting the impact of exponentiality is difficult, and our scientific understanding of a subject is still developing, making predictions sometimes little better than guesswork. Self-driving cars have proven to be harder to develop than anticipated, and unforeseen consequences confound over and underestimation. For instance, American chewing gum sales fell 15% just as 220 million American adults bought their first smartphone, and gum sales plummeted as people spent their time playing with their phones. Our inability to make accurate predictions about exponentiality was exemplified during the Covid-19 pandemic when most of us consistently underestimated how rapidly it would spread.

Exponential growth is hard to predict and adapt to, as exemplified by the Covid-19 pandemic, which people consistently underestimated. Politicians downplayed the risk, and early research showed exponential growth bias at play. Our failure to predict the cadence of exponential change and adapt to it is due to our institutions' inbuilt tendency towards incrementalism, which runs slower than the speed of change. The phenomenon is not new and has happened before in history, such as the 50-year period in the nineteenth century called Engels pause, where British GDP expanded rapidly, but workers' wages remained the same.

The Industrial Revolution brought about significant improvements in wealth, lifespan, and quality of life, but it also caused unwelcome changes in working conditions, with workers enduring longer hours and poor living conditions. Charles Dickens chronicled the exploitation and misery of the era, while Robert Southey described the infernal working conditions of Birmingham. It took decades for wages to catch up with the growth driven by technology.

The working conditions in Birmingham during the Industrial Revolution were characterized by noise, filth, and sickness. Friedrich Engels described urban living conditions as wretched, and the state's failure to regulate working practices reflected a pre-modern political order. Today, institutions face the challenge of keeping up with rapidly changing technologies, which are causing radical change in a matter of years or sometimes months, and the gap is growing bigger quickly.

Institutions are more than just buildings; they are systems that govern our lives and how we relate to each other. They are arrangements between groups in society that provide stability. Institutions can take various forms, including formal and embodied ones. Laws and legal systems are primary institutions that govern our lives, but not all institutions need to be formal.

Unwritten rules and norms are also types of institutions that guide our collective behavior and bring stability. However, institutions are not cut out to develop or adapt at an exponential pace, and even the most institutional institutions can be slow to adapt. Almost none of the institutions are particularly fast-moving.

Kodak engineer Steve Sasson created an electronic still camera in 1975, which received a patent in 1979, but Kodak failed to capitalize on it. Despite recognizing the potential of digital cameras and even acquiring a photo-sharing site, Kodak's institutional knowledge and focus on traditional film and prints hindered their ability to pivot their business strategy to compete with more successful companies like Instagram.

Kodak's failure to adapt to digital cameras led to their eventual bankruptcy, and Microsoft also struggled to keep up with technological changes. Microsoft was slow to recognize the disruptive power of the internet and later underestimated the potential of the iPhone, leading to the company ceding key parts of the internet and mobile markets to other companies. Former CEO Steve Ballmer cited a failure to apply his understanding of the PC industry to the new smartphone industry as a reason for the company's missteps.

The article discusses how companies and institutions can struggle to adapt to rapid technological changes. Microsoft successfully pivoted to cloud computing under CEO Satya Nadella, while sociologist William Ogburn noted a cultural lag in institutions' response to new technologies. The rise of smartphones and video games has also challenged cultural conventions and values.

The article explores why institutions, including social norms and companies, struggle to adapt to new technologies. Sociologists attribute this to path dependence, where early practices and customs have long-running effects. Institutions can adapt through layering, drift, and conversion, but they often remain rooted in outdated ways of responding to issues.

Institutions tend to be slow to change and can become embedded in outdated practices and norms, leading to institutional drift. The UK's National Health Service and the BBC's early website launch are examples of this. Wars and revolutions can prompt rapid institutional change, but it takes a significant shock to overcome institutional slowness. In the Exponential Age, predicting institutional change is challenging.

The exponential gap is the difference between the rapid development of technology and the slow pace of institutional change. In the early 2000s, the gap was not a significant problem, but as exponential technology became systematically important, the gap has become an existential issue. Exponential technologies are becoming the medium through which we interact with each other, the state, and the economy, creating a two-tier society. Those who understand and harness the power of exponentiality will do better than those who do not.

The exponential gap between those who have embraced new technology and those who haven't can be addressed by either slowing down technological advancement or better preparing for it. Slowing down technological progress may not be desirable as urgent issues such as climate change require exponential technology. It is better to prepare for the period of accelerating technologies to address problems like providing good-quality healthcare, education, sanitation and power to the poorest.

Closing the exponential gap can be done by making the lower line rise faster, equipping social institutions to adapt, preparing for rapid change, and developing new ways of organizing society. The exponential gap is emerging in various sectors, and radical thinking is needed to prevent it from eroding society. The traditional rules of business, where large companies dominated the economy, are being challenged by new technologies, and successful companies must adapt to changing norms and systems.

As companies get bigger, bureaucracy and complexity increase, leading to slower decision-making and decreased agility. Firms may develop a narrow specialty to escape this problem and gain a competitive advantage, but this can make them less entrepreneurial. Large firms also become short-sighted and conservative, and it becomes increasingly expensive for them to get bigger due to diminishing marginal returns. The gravitational pull of scale leads to a decreasing return for every dollar invested, and dominance is hard to achieve.

In many industries, competition is meant to keep companies honest and prevent bad behavior, but the corporate titans of the Exponential Age dominate their markets with very high market shares. Google controls 80-95% of search queries in different countries, Android is installed on 4 out of 5 smartphones globally, and Facebook and Google account for over 90% of global online advertising spend. Such dominance can provoke the ire of the state and can result in bad behavior like price gouging. This is different from traditional industries, where no company had a dominant market share, and even Coca-Cola was not much larger than its closest competitor.

Superstar companies, such as Amazon, Google, and Uber, are dominating various markets and appear to have powers that defy traditional business constraints, such as slower growth. They are more productive, innovative, and aggressive than their competitors and have become commonplace around the world. As digitization increases, companies become more prone to superstarification. Top-performing firms generate the majority of profits, and the most digitized industries have the highest propensity for superstarification.

Superstar firms, driven by exponential technologies, are achieving market dominance across various industries, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario. The difference between the best and worst firms is greater now than ever, and massive scale emerges organically without the need for monopolistic tactics. However, it is unclear if this is beneficial for the economy or society, and regulatory bodies are needed to govern their operations and define their obligations.

There is a growing mismatch between the norms and rules in place to regulate companies and the ways in which superstar firms operate, resulting in an exponential gap. The emergence of new networks, unevenly distributed benefits, and the network effect are driving the rise of these superstar companies. The smallest advantage can lead to lasting success, while the smallest slip-up can cause a company to become irrelevant. This exponential gap is taking over the economy, and existing norms and rules seem antiquated. This raises questions about how to respond to uncompetitive markets and how to tax large global companies.

The benefits of a technology, such as a fax machine, increase with every additional recipient and create a network externality, which is a positive externality that benefits everyone in the network. This phenomenon is not new and has existed since ancient times in physical markets. Many successful companies in the Exponential Age, such as Facebook, PayPal, Microsoft, Google, and eBay, owe their success to the network effect.

The network effect drives the success of companies like Facebook, Visa, and Microsoft, making them stronger as they get bigger. Microsoft dominated the operating system market due to the network effect, which gave it a larger user base and made it more attractive to software developers. This positive feedback loop makes a business more desirable for users and developers, creating a cycle of growth.

Microsoft's dominance in the operating system market made it difficult for competitors to break in due to the network effect, which also helped the company win the productivity software war against companies like Lotus and WordPerfect. Once Microsoft established dominance, it became easier for users to continue using its products due to the network effect. The network effect also benefits non-profit organizations like Wikipedia, as it becomes the preferred source for readers and contributors due to network externalities.

Network externalities, or the positive effect of more contributors attracting more readers, can result in a winner-takes-all market where it becomes difficult to challenge the established leader. This effect is driven by consumers who seek the most value, and is more pronounced in the Exponential Age due to digital technologies' ability to take advantage of network effects without the need for cumbersome device supply. The World Wide Web's dominance over other information networks is an example of this phenomenon.

The shift towards digital technologies and the widespread availability of internet connections has allowed for the emergence of platform businesses, which connect producers to consumers without producing or consuming much themselves. These businesses differ from traditional industrial-age companies, which organized themselves according to a linear value chain. Platforms like eBay and Facebook offer a service that matches different types of people rather than selling goods, and they take advantage of network effects to attract more users.

Digital technology has enabled the emergence of massive online platforms that can bring together buyers and sellers without physical limitations of scale. This has contributed to the rise of superstar companies, which can grow to extraordinary sizes and offer a greater range of choices than any physical marketplace could offer. The unbounded power of these platforms allows for a cornucopia of choices for buyers and sellers, attracting more people to use them.

Platforms are capital-efficient as they facilitate exchange without having to spend much money. The platform business model is increasingly ubiquitous, allowing exponential age platforms to creep into any geography and industry. The wider ecosystem pays for logistical processes while the platform takes a commission. This model has been adopted by various companies globally, even in the online medical consultation industry.

The Exponential Age is marked by the proliferation of platforms and network effects, leading to the emergence of exponential corporations that rely on intangible assets for their value. Traditional companies that focus on tangible assets may be left behind. Examples include Ping An, which employs specialists on an as-needed basis, and high-tech firms that build physical things while relying on the value of their software, data, and algorithms.

The shift to intangible assets has been remarkable, with intangibles accounting for 84% of the value of companies on the S&P 500 in 2015, compared to 17% in 1975. The largest firms in the world, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Tencent, derive most of their value from intangibles. The value of a product now comes from research, design, branding, and service, with the actual manufacturing process becoming less important. The migration to intangible assets is driven by factors such as advances in technology, globalization, and changes in business models.

The increasing complexity of products and growing global markets have led to the rise of intangible assets as key drivers of the economy. Intangible knowledge is expensive to produce but cheap to copy, making it more commercially important in bigger markets. Winner-takes-all markets are becoming more prevalent as companies can scale at an unprecedented pace and size in the intangible economy. Intangible assets, such as algorithms and artificial intelligence, are the bricks that make up exponential companies.

The cycle of feeding data into AI and getting more value without doing much leads to the data network effect, where the product becomes smarter as it gets more data from users. Google effectively captured the data network effect by using data to improve the quality of its rankings, and other companies such as Netflix also use data to improve their suggestions. Data network effects are like a perpetual motion machine for intangible assets, and companies that master this cycle can benefit greatly.

The emergence of Exponential Age superstars, fueled by the shift towards intangible assets and network effects, has fundamentally changed the logic of the global economy. These companies can scale easily, leading to exponential growth and leaving behind their rivals. The most valuable firms in the world are Exponential Age companies, while traditional businesses struggle to keep up. Google remains dominant in online search due to its ability to scale using intangible assets.

Superstar companies such as Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook are growing at a faster rate than the global economy, defying the law of diminishing returns to scale. These companies have learned to push past the limits that once restricted a company's size, experiencing increasing returns to scale instead. Salesforce, a company that pioneered software as a service, has grown from a handful of founders to a $200-billion business by making each additional employee more productive and getting more money from its customers. Customers love Salesforce, which continues to grow despite its size.

Salesforce and Netflix are examples of companies that have grown exponentially due to the dynamics of increasing returns to scale. The winner-takes-all mindset of these companies reflects a market where one dominant player exists in each sector. These companies have grown without taking on many more staff and by leveraging their intangible assets. Increasing returns to scale are also impacting culture and wider society, as seen in the case of Netflix's content production and Oscar nominations.

The article discusses the shift in organizational design towards network effect-based businesses that prioritize growth over efficiency. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs such as Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel emphasize the importance of "blitzscaling" and identifying markets where they can dominate to achieve exponential growth. In the Exponential Age, second place is not an option for these superstar firms.



Obsession with constant growth leads to horizontal expansion, as seen in Alibaba's expansion into adjacent markets through its finance arm, Ant Financial. 

Ant Financial uses data science and network effects to become more powerful and effective, expanding into increasingly distant portions of the market. 

Ant Financial's expansion led to customers using multiple parts of its service, resulting in the company offering five businesses: payments, wealth management, credit scoring, lending, and insurance.



Exponential logic leads to both horizontal and vertical expansion in firms. 

Horizontal expansion involves moving into adjacent markets and offering new products/services, as seen in Apple and Amazon's businesses. 

Vertical expansion involves taking control of the supply chain, and has become more popular in the Exponential Age. 

Google's advertising business is a vertically integrated system that allows advertisers to buy ad space using only Google products.

Big tech companies like Google, Apple, and Tesla have engaged in vertical integration by acquiring other companies and making their own hardware, such as computer chips. They also invest heavily in research and development to create new sectors that they can dominate, even if it is not directly related to their main source of revenue. Alphabet, for example, has researchers working on cold fusion.

Alphabet's research and development spans across various sectors, including energy, life sciences, and self-driving cars. The increasing dominance of superstar companies like Alphabet may pose a new kind of problem, requiring a different approach to antitrust laws that focuses on consumer welfare rather than a company's size or market position.

The consumer experience in the technology and internet sectors seems to be getting cheaper and more efficient despite the tendency towards monopoly in some sectors. However, the new age of monopoly may lead to the exploitation of smaller-scale producers, such as the App Store's fees charged by Apple to software developers. The existing norms and rules do not account for the real issues created by monopolistic companies in the Exponential Age.

Apple charges developers fees for using the App Store, but it provides them with access to billions of people who use iPhones, a secure and trusted environment for buying apps, and an easy buying process. However, many developers believe that Apple's fees are not worth 30% of their efforts, and the absence of a competitive market makes it difficult to determine a fair price. Oligopolistic practices that hurt sellers rather than consumers are common across platforms, such as Google's vertical integration of its ad business. Google's dominance in the online advertising industry has led to questionable business practices.

Google was fined $1.8 billion for abusing its dominant position in the ads market. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority also expressed concerns over Google's vertical integration in the advertising market. The loss of dynamism in the Exponential Age is affecting small businesses that need to buy ads, but young companies are still growing quickly, and more start-ups are being created and funded than ever before. Venture capitalists continue to back the creation of new companies, suggesting a dynamic and vibrant economy.

Large firms are buying nascent competitors, which has long-term consequences for innovation. Breakthrough inventions are more likely to come from individual inventors or smaller teams. Corporate giants can narrow the focus of research in fields where they dominate, reducing the number of pathways being explored. Tech companies are even diverting scientists' attention away from big-picture scientific research by poaching university professors to help with their corporate priorities. Between 2004 and 2018, North American universities saw 221 AI professors leave academia to pursue a career in the computer industry or start their own.

The article discusses the impact of technology giants in the Exponential Age on society, including the brain drain of AI academics to industry, the risk of research becoming more focused on commercial priorities, and the issue of tax avoidance through clever strategies like the Double Irish. The article suggests that these issues may pose risks to the wider functioning of society.

The article suggests that the problems posed by technology giants in the Exponential Age can be addressed through a change in mindset and a new approach to antitrust regulation. It discusses the implications of the dominance of big tech companies, such as conflicts of interest and threats to data privacy, and proposes alternative frameworks for identifying monopolies. The article argues that once new rules are in place to deal with large companies, it will become easier to prevent them from wielding too much power.

Antitrust bodies need to be more confident in blocking big companies from acquiring smaller ones to prevent future monopolies. Regulators should reserve the right to approve any acquisition by the largest companies and insist on interoperability between platforms, especially for firms that get to a certain size, to tamper the network effects that enable companies to get ever larger. This approach would stop exponential age platforms from buying up areas of the market and growing so large organically.

Interoperability preserves the positive benefits of network effects while curbing the monopoly power of a single company. The journey towards interoperable communication services has been taken before, as seen in the early 1990s when mobile phone companies were in silos. Interoperability became commonplace in the industry, driving up phone usage and vastly improving customer experience. Today, there are steps towards making interoperability a reality across sectors, such as the movement towards open banking.

The Digital Markets Act proposed by the European Commission in December 2020 puts new obligations on dominant network platforms, including compulsory interoperability between platforms. Digital firms have become an essential part of our lives and should be treated more like utilities with higher regulatory standards and responsibilities. This includes offering reasonable services to all residents and fair access to infrastructure for competitors.

Openreach, a separate company owned by BT, was created to sell services to any phone company that wanted equal access to BT's backbone network. The proposed Digital Services Act by the European Commission places new obligations on big tech companies with over 10% of European reach, including greater reporting and data sharing with researchers and authorities. The winner-takes-all market is becoming increasingly prevalent, and policymakers and regulators need to intervene to close the exponential gap. The slow pace of institutional change has hindered action against superstar companies despite their long-standing dominance.

The government's attempts to regulate the world's largest industry have been limited by applying outdated thinking. However, policies that close the gap between exponential growth and regulation are accessible through various channels. Concerns about automation replacing human jobs have a long history, from the industrial revolution to current times. Workers' anger at machines taking their jobs has led to movements such as the Luddites, who destroyed automated looms in the 1810s. The rules themselves must change to accommodate the new era.

Anxieties about automation replacing human jobs are not new and have historically led to movements such as the Luddites destroying machines. Rapid technological change and advancements in AI are challenging workers' livelihoods, with machines performing tasks better than humans. The threat of automation is framed as a more existential threat than fears of technological unemployment. However, the actual impact on workers remains an open question, with the prospect of mass redundancy looming.

Geoffrey Hinton, an AI pioneer, predicted that deep learning would outperform radiologists within five years and advised people to stop training radiologists. While machine vision has improved in the last five years, radiologists remain in high demand and short supply, with their numbers actually increasing over the past decade. Therefore, Hinton's prediction was not entirely accurate, and radiologists continue to be essential in the healthcare industry.

While automation is excelling at once-human tasks, it is creating more work than it destroys and has the potential to create new sectors of the economy. The rise of robots narrative is a distraction from the fact that technology is revolutionizing how we work and has the potential to cause workplace exploitation if not handled properly. The quantity of jobs will likely remain high, but the quality of jobs and the relationships between employers and employees may change. The shortage of radiologists and machines suggests that automation can help overworked professionals rather than make them redundant.

The emergence of new technology and business models is creating an exponential gap between working arrangements and outdated norms, which is causing a decline in workers' income, skill building opportunities, and say in their working conditions. The shift to gig-working and the use of sensors and analytics is boosting efficiency and productivity but at the expense of workers' wellbeing, and the share of value going to the workforce is declining. While the idea of mass automation and job losses due to AI breakthroughs is not new, the continuous improvement of AI and its adaptability is making it a real threat to human jobs.

Research has predicted that advanced computerized systems such as machine learning could make up to 47% of the US workforce redundant. Many companies, including Deutsche Bank, launched initiatives to eliminate white-collar labor, leading to a boom in office automation. Automation is gathering pace and is predicted to affect employment statistics.

Manufacturing output in the US increased while factory employment declined due to technological advancements, with five workers producing the same value of finished goods that previously took 25 workers. Tech companies in the Exponential Age require fewer employees but generate more revenue per employee. However, before the COVID-19 pandemic, employment levels were at record highs globally, with the OECD reporting the highest employment levels since before the 2008 financial crisis.

Despite the threat of automation to jobs, unemployment was at its lowest since 2009, and automation may be harder than it seems due to the difficulty of automating many jobs, known as Moravec's paradox. While technology is improving, it takes time for exponential processes to mature, and many human skills are difficult for computers to replicate. Wall Street trading and fruit picking are used as examples of high-skill and low-skill sectors that are still difficult to automate.

The use of algorithmic trading has largely replaced human traders in the financial industry, with nearly 70% of shares traded automatically. Even fund managers are being replaced by automated systems, with more than half of global assets under management going to simple rules-based funds. This is due to the fact that managing assets can be done better by computer programs than by humans. However, this level of automation is not typical for most jobs in other industries.

Many jobs involve tasks and knowledge that are not written down and are learned through experience, including workplace interactions and codes that emerge as people interact with each other. This tacit knowledge is particularly important in jobs that involve human interaction and emotional labor, such as care work, and may prove difficult to automate.

Artificial intelligence (AI) faces difficulty in replicating human job skills due to the existence of tacit knowledge in the workplace. AI needs clear and unambiguous goals and training on complete data, but the hidden know-how in a job makes it challenging to build AI systems that can perform the job. Automation occurs step by step by dividing work into smaller, manageable pieces that are simplified. Currently, AI systems are only viable for relatively simple and everyday tasks, and full automation is still some way off.

Automation is a tool that companies can use to become more competitive, and it is unlikely to cause mass unemployment. Amazon, the most technically sophisticated retailer, is an aggressively automated company that uses automation to coordinate internal systems. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the transition to a digital world, with online shopping booming and digital giants like Amazon emerging as winners. Automation is a fringe force in the Exponential Age, limited to specific tasks and sectors, but its effects may soon affect a wider array of jobs.

Amazon has become a leader in automation and robotics, with 200,000 robots sorting billions of packages worldwide. Despite fears of job loss due to automation, Amazon and other companies that invested in automation continued to hire during the pandemic, suggesting that automation can create more jobs than it destroys. Other companies like Netflix also continued to hire despite their reliance on AI algorithms. The reason for this is that automation typically increases productivity and efficiency, leading to business growth and the need for more workers.

The idea that automation will lead to job loss is challenged by examples of companies like Amazon, Netflix, Ocado, and JD.com, who have invested in automation but continue to hire more employees as they grow. Automation often leads to increased productivity and business growth, creating a need for more workers. The real threat to jobs is not automation itself but the failure of companies to keep up with new technologies and invest in employee training. Therefore, automation is more like a story of two friends encountering a grizzly bear on a hike, where success depends on the ability to adapt and respond quickly to changes.

Adaptability is key to thriving in the age of automation, as seen in the case of Blockbuster losing out to Netflix due to a lack of adaptation. A survey of French manufacturing companies found that firms adopting robots became more profitable, productive and created jobs. The competitive threat from rival companies who adopt automation is the real threat, rather than automation itself. Slow-to-adapt laggards are the problem.

Individual companies benefit from automation but it can still lead to job losses across society. A French study found that automation leads to overall job losses. Research by economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo found that robots led to job losses and reduced wages in the US. However, a European study found that each additional robot per 1,000 workers increased overall employment. Overall, automation is predicted to create more jobs than it destroys, according to the World Economic Forum. The idea that automation upsets the equilibrium of the labour force and creates unemployment has been challenged by recent studies.

The belief that increasing female labor participation, allowing immigration, or using robots will reduce available work for workers is a fallacy called the "lump of labor fallacy." The development of new technologies creates new needs, which bring new sectors of the economy and require suitably skilled workers. An example of this is Sid Karunaratne, who was hired to tend to servers for a data analytics and prediction start-up. His job required him to fix bugs, update code, and address security vulnerabilities. The development of new technologies creates new jobs, rather than reducing available work.

As a data analytics and prediction start-up grew, the computing demands increased exponentially. Sid Karunaratne, who tended to the servers, mastered new skills and automated his job, creating more opportunities for himself and the team. Automation creates more opportunities for new and important tasks, which in turn generates more work. This process is seen with many technologies and is creating new types of jobs across the economy, as seen with companies investing in artificial intelligence, such as Aurora building self-driving trucks.

Automation leads to more jobs in the long-term, but can cause short-term job loss. The focus should be on the quality of available job options. Uber demonstrates how the gig economy provides work for millions of freelancers despite the talk of mass automation.

Uber's success in using platform-based gig work at a large scale raises questions about employment in the Exponential Age. The gig economy's origins can be traced back to Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform, where hidden human labor is used to perform small and well-defined tasks just beyond the reach of current AI systems.

Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform, allowed companies to outsource manual data classification to workers for a small fee, leading to the emergence of crowdsourcing. Other platforms like Elance and Fiverr were created for more complex tasks, and the rise of smartphones enabled local and convenient services.

Crowdsourcing evolved into the gig economy, underpinned by the emerging exponential economy and enabled by the internet and smartphone. Gig platforms like Uber have upended stable markets and created more gig workers. The gig economy is a more imminent and transformative force than mass automation, and while gig economy founders claim it helps workers, it also raises concerns about job security and worker exploitation.

Gig-working platforms make labor markets more efficient by connecting buyers and sellers, leading to an increase in job opportunities. They can also make it easier for workers to access the global economy and work part-time. Uber and Kobo360 are examples of gig-working platforms expanding markets in developed and emerging economies, respectively. The second benefit of gig work is the flexibility it offers to workers.

Gig work offers flexibility and independence to workers in developed countries, with pay and schedule as top priorities. In emerging economies, gig work can offer more security and formal employment options than the informal labor market. However, there are concerns about poor pay, precarious working patterns, lack of protections for workers, unilateral changes by platforms, and the absence of collective voice or representation for gig workers.

Gig workers in the platform economy face a huge power imbalance with low pay being a common issue due to having to cover their own expenses. Precarious working conditions and lack of benefits are prevalent, with the platforms arguing that their workers are not employees but independent contractors. Many gig workers earn less than minimum wage, with one study estimating an Uber driver's average profit to be $3.37 per hour.

Companies using gig labor have generally been reluctant to offer their workforce protections. California passed a bill in 2019 classifying freelancers as employees, but Uber, Lyft and DoorDash successfully passed Proposition 22, granting them an exception. In London, Uber lost a case arguing that drivers should be considered workers under British law. Judges concluded that drivers were not self-employed entrepreneurs and that Uber controlled all aspects of their work, placing them in a position of subordination.

Exponential technologies have enabled new modes of employment, but labor laws designed in the twentieth century haven't caught up, creating a growing inequality between gig workers and official employees. The self-employed may swell to the hundreds of millions, and only a small group will retain the privileges workers have fought to gain over the last 150 years. Time recorders, an early move towards a more scientific system of people management, represented one of the defining inventions of the twentieth-century workplace.

Methods of managing employees became more sophisticated, including scientific management pioneered by Frederick Winslow Taylor, who quantified human behavior at work to optimize output. Taylorism led to constant surveillance of workers, draconian punishments for underperforming employees, and a tendency to treat workers like machines. The approach of personality and psychological testing for personnel management staff soon became the norm in large organizations, leading to a classic twentieth-century deal of high-security, low-freedom work.

Workplace norms in technology companies have shifted towards greater autonomy and employee benefits such as free food, unlimited time off, and even fertility treatments. These perks became more common in the second decade of the 21st century, with some companies offering life coaching and yoga classes. Some companies, like Google and Netflix, also provide unusually generous benefits such as unlimited vacation time and death benefits. This trend was already established before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Digital tools have allowed for greater remote work flexibility, which was accelerated during COVID-19 lockdowns. However, not all companies provide this freedom, and the same technologies that enable remote work can also be used for employee surveillance. Workplace devices can be likened to an inescapable digital panopticon, as every message and document update is logged, making it difficult for employees to know when they are being watched. Many firms use facial recognition and mood detection systems for surveillance.

Employers are increasingly using technology to monitor and measure their employees' productivity, mood, and movements, with some using brainwave-reading hats and video analysis software for job interviews. This trend has accelerated with the shift to remote work during the pandemic, and a significant proportion of employees believe they are being monitored. The issue is not just surveillance, but also automated management, which can limit workers' control over how they work.

The success of gig economy companies, especially ride-hailing firms, is built on algorithmic management that scrutinizes workers' performance through quantitative assessments. Workers are managed by computers and punished for failing to meet algorithmic targets, creating a dehumanizing system reminiscent of Taylorism but with fewer job protections. The power imbalance between workers and bosses is heavily skewed in favor of the latter, with workers lacking the collective bargaining power of the past. This system has resulted in low pay, lack of job stability, and a lack of concern for workers' well-being.

The use of algorithms in the workplace can lead to the control and monitoring of workers, limiting their decision-making and agency. This creates a growing gap between high-quality and low-quality, insecure work, leading to a decline in workers' share of national income over the last 50 years. Without careful consideration, work may no longer serve the interests of society.

Workers' share of national income has declined significantly over the past 50 years, particularly in the US, resulting in stagnating wages and increased inequality. The decline is related to globalization, the decline of unions, the rise of the intangible economy, and superstarification. These factors have led to a decrease in bargaining power for workers, who are now competing for a smaller share of the economic pie.

Exponential technologies have led to the rise of a high-tech, intangible economy dominated by a few big companies, causing two-thirds of worker loss due to the transition to intangibles and the growth of superstar firms. Jobs created by these technologies, such as engineering jobs at Uber, pay well, but gig workers like Uber drivers are often paid relatively little. At Facebook, half of all employees make $240,000 or more, while content moderators are contracted via temping agencies and paid on average $28,000 per year. This dynamic extends beyond digital platforms, such as in the case of Zymergen.

The Exponential Age economy favors highly educated knowledge workers, resulting in a reduced share of income going to employees and a disappearing middle-wage group. Despite the long-term benefits of technological innovation, there are winners and losers in global labor markets, with some workers facing obsolescence and poor conditions. It took a century for ordinary workers' wages to catch up with technology gains during the industrial revolution, highlighting the complexities of labor markets.

The article argues that despite the widening gap between new technology and the norms and laws governing the workplace, it's not too late to redesign the economy for a fairer work settlement. Workers need dignity and greater autonomy over how they work. New workplace technologies, even surveillance technologies, can be used in a non-exploitative way provided workers are given a say in how they are used. The article suggests that new ideas about adapting to the Exponential Age are emerging, but it may take time for them to become a reality.

The article suggests that workers need to be given more insight into the data that firms hold about them and clearer explanations on how automated decisions are made. Unions can help workers win back data rights. Workers need to be constantly reskilled as industries will change rapidly. Digital technology can help with reskilling, and apps like TikTok can be the future of education. Flexibility is also important, as work in the Exponential Age is volatile and requires workers to adapt constantly.

TikTok is being used to disseminate information and for micro-learning, but it cannot alone reskill the economy. Digital learning has potential, and workers need a safety net to avoid losing their jobs. Universal basic income (UBI) is suggested by some academics and technologists as a solution, but it remains controversial in many countries. Denmark has a similar alternative policy in place. Small-scale experiments with UBI in Stockton and Helsinki have shown increased wellbeing and lower food distress for recipients, and they are more likely to return to work within a year.

The flexicurity model in Denmark provides both flexibility for employers and security for employees. The model guarantees extensive protections and benefits from the state for unemployed individuals, making it a potential solution for the challenges posed by the Exponential Age. Workers also need equity, and employers must invest in their development to move into more skilled roles. However, this may accentuate the gap between low- and high-skilled workers, making minimum-wage bargaining more important than ever.

Policymakers must ensure minimum wage reflects the cost of living, and address wage differentials between rich and poor workers by promoting wage transparency. Closing income gaps requires effort, but it's not impossible, as organizations like Portify are already helping gig workers build credit ratings. However, meaningful improvements for workers historically come from employee pressure, not just entrepreneurship or benevolent bosses. The UK labor movement began in the 1880s.

New unionism emerged to appeal to urban working class; unions played a key role in improving workers' conditions and the emergence of social democratic parties. However, unions have faced significant decline in the Anglosphere due to political and economic factors, and have fallen out of fashion. Thatcher's government and Reagan's firing of air-traffic controllers marked turning points in unionism. The tech industry has historically been anti-union, with its founders seeing it as essential for survival. Union membership in the US, UK, France, and others is at its lowest level since records began.

Workers trying to unionize in tech companies have faced obstacles and interference from their employers. Collective action through unions is necessary to ensure fair workplaces. Digital technology is both a problem and a solution in the world of trade unions, as it enables workers to connect and organize through platforms like WhatsApp and online forums. In West Virginia, teachers set up an invite-only Facebook group and 70% of the state's 35,000 teachers joined.

Digitally enabled unions can help workers organize globally and adapt to the changing economy. The power imbalance between bosses and workers in the Exponential Age is a consequence but not an inevitable one. Pix Moving, a start-up based in Guiyang, faced challenges due to the US government's tariffs on Chinese imports, making everything more expensive.

Pix Moving, a start-up, uses dematerialized techniques and additive manufacturing to export design blueprints for cars to colleagues in the US, who print components locally and assemble the finished product near the consumer. This represents a return to local manufacturing and challenges assumptions about globalisation. This is made possible by advancements in 3D printing technology, which allows for local production of components. This is a departure from the longer supply chains and international production processes of the past.

The third phase of globalisation, predicted by Thomas Friedman, would see even greater flows of trade, labour, and information. International institutions, such as the World Trade Organization and the European Union, helped to flatten the world, and the private sector had its own infrastructure of globalisation. The transformative power of globalisation brought many benefits, including increased wealth around the world and reduced poverty. However, it also created winners and losers, and its impact on the environment and social cohesion has been criticized.

Globalisation, which accelerated the development of exponential technologies and new businesses, lost its appeal after the global financial crisis due to concerns about income inequality, immigration, and deindustrialisation. Exponential technologies, which were expected to lead to a more borderless world, actually facilitate a return to the local, favouring the near over the far. These technologies enable local production of energy and food, making it more affordable.

The potential of exponential technologies to localize economic activity is becoming more powerful, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of global supply chains. This new era of localism is an ironic result of the economic paradigm of globalization that fostered these technologies. Political and economic systems are struggling to cope with this new age of localism, and gaps are emerging between countries that can adapt and those that can't. The world is becoming spiky, and economic benefits traditionally associated with trading may now be more productive than self-sufficiency.

The article discusses the benefits of countries specializing in producing and exporting goods they are relatively good at producing. Global trade has allowed for complex supply chains and the exchange of goods across borders. This has resulted in improved efficiency and access to a wider variety of products for consumers.

The article discusses the potential for urban vertical farming to revolutionize the way we produce and source food locally, using high-tech methods to increase productivity and reduce environmental impact. This could eliminate the need for transporting food from rural to urban areas, making local production more efficient and sustainable.



Urban farms are being built close to retailers for fresher produce and cultivated for nutrition, with high-intensity vertical farms' market growing at more than 20% per annum. 

New technology reduces our dependence on certain classes of commodities, such as fossil fuels, which have driven a large portion of world trade for the past century. 

Renewables have put every nation on a path to energy independence, requiring few raw materials once installed.



The shift to renewable energy drastically reduces the amount of materials that need to be transported, with coal demand for electricity down by 94% in the UK since 1998. 

The shift towards renewables reduces global dependence on fossil-rich nations and allows for more equitable distribution of energy sources, with solar energy being possible everywhere. 

New methods of energy storage bring electricity closer to home, such as electric vehicles that can hoard electricity for home and office use.

Electric cars can lend their stored electricity to homes through vehicle-to-grid systems, and the surplus energy stored in 11 million British electric cars by 2030 could potentially cover the country's energy needs. Inventor Simon Daniel is stringing together thousands of idle car batteries to form a giant virtual power plant managed by sophisticated algorithms. This could replace massive power stations with parked cars keeping homes running. Biotech startup Zymergen uses advanced machine learning and genetics to efficiently produce industrial materials.

Biotech start-up Zymergen uses natural processes to grow screen film for smartphones, reducing the need for plastics made from oil. While the transition to a fully green economy may take until the late 21st century, the trend is towards an economy based on less stuff and re-localisation of commodity production. Manufacturing is becoming more localised, with building processes taking place close to the point of consumption, driven by the surging importance of intangible assets in the exponential economy.

The value of products is increasingly in their intangible aspects such as design, orchestration, and brand. New manufacturing technologies require fewer workers and allow for production in high labor cost countries. Adidas experimented with a small-scale factory in Germany that relied on robots, automation, and 3D printing, but eventually moved its technology back to Asia due to cost concerns. However, additive manufacturing technologies are riding an exponential wave, and 3D printing is a part of this trend.

3D printing technologies are improving rapidly, and costs will decrease as they become more widely used. During the Covid-19 pandemic, volunteer efforts using 3D printers demonstrated the potential of this technology to produce much-needed medical supplies. The global market for 3D printing is currently small, but it is growing and finding uses among demanding customers in industries such as automotive and aviation. 3D printing can save money by using less material, and waste less. BMW is already producing tens of thousands of components using 3D printing. This new technology could change the traditional system of global trade.

The re-localisation of production due to the use of new technology may lead to destabilization of developing countries' economies as rich countries become less dependent on their commodities. Developing countries primarily export raw materials, and their economic fortunes are tied to commodities prices. The economies of developing countries may suffer if the demand for their raw materials decreases in the rich world due to re-localisation of production.

The shift towards localised manufacturing, such as 3D printing, could eliminate up to 40% of world imports by 2040, causing devastating effects on parts of the developing world that depend on global demand for cheap labor. Decreasing reliance on commodities could also lead to political instability and exacerbate the gap between the rich and poor worlds. The compounding effect of these technologies may transform the global supply chain and disrupt economies, cultures, and societies built on global demand for cheap labor.

The high cost of maintaining global security and stability has eroded the authority of states and multilateral institutions. US energy sufficiency has made the country less willing to intervene in petrostates. The effects of exponential technology will be transformative, with high-tech economies thriving and others getting left behind. More than half of the world's population now reside in metropolitan areas, marking a new era. Throughout history, cities did not achieve the scale of over one million inhabitants until London in the nineteenth century.

Cities have consistently been underestimated and neglected in political and institutional metrics despite being the engine of wealth creation, scientific discovery, trade, and culture. In the Exponential Age, the intangible economy will make cities more important as they attract highly skilled knowledge workers who cluster around physical institutions like universities. Complex technologies require many specialists working together, and cities are the ideal hub for these specialisms.

Cities with an accumulation of talented individuals from various sectors foster innovation and new ideas, making them ideal for high-tech industries. The process of agglomeration leads to specialized intangible-powered cities like Mumbai for Bollywood and Hsinchu for chip-making. The proximity of people in cities leads to innovation as strangers mix and new ideas pollinate, making cities a hub of serendipity.

Cities are full of strangers and this mingling fosters innovation and perpetuates their growth, creating a positive feedback loop. As cities grow, professional opportunities, social life, and attractiveness increase, leading to more people investing in the city. This growth is expected to continue in developing countries, with the emergence of more megacities, such as the Greater Bay Area in China, which has a population of over 70 million people.

Cities, especially in Africa, are growing rapidly and becoming more dependent on high-tech and emerging sectors for economic development. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary flight from cities, but most residents eventually returned. As cities grow in size and wealth, a gap may develop between urban citizens and the rest of the population, leading to tension and conflicts between national and city-level governments. This is exemplified by the case of Uber in London, where the city's suspension of the company's license was not supported by the national government.

There is tension between liberal, high-tech cities and less liberal, poorer national governments, exemplified by clashes over immigration policies. Exponential technologies give cities more autonomy and self-sufficiency, favoring large and diverse urban populations. This is shifting the significance from the nation state to great cities, resulting in conflicts over decision-making. The future will likely see constant conflicts between cities and nations, raising questions about where decisions should occur.

In his declaration, Barlow stated that the internet is naturally independent of national borders and governments, and therefore not subject to their tyranny. The internet allowed for the free flow of ideas across borders and undermined territorial sovereignty. The early internet was a place for exploring ideas that couldn't be expressed in national press, and helped build a uniquely international culture online, although the norms of the early internet had a distinctly American hue.

The key protocols and institutions of governance of the internet were created by Americans, bringing with it academic and liberal values. The ideal of a global, borderless internet is being fragmented into national spheres, with governments finding new ways to bring the internet under their control. Authoritarian regimes have been restricting internet access through censorship and surveillance, and this dynamic has spread to liberal democracies. European data protection laws are a benign attempt to protect citizens' digital rights but place limits on data flow. Governments in some countries see data as a national asset and are creating restrictions on how it can be transferred out of the country.

The internet is becoming more localized with the rise of territorial rules around data and the physical building of data farms in countries. This trend challenges the assumption that locality is irrelevant in the era of globalization and poses a problem for policymakers as institutions guiding global policy were built on this assumption. Creative solutions are needed to bridge the gap between high-tech, rich nations and their poorer counterparts, as well as between liberal cities and conservative national polities.

International cooperation remains important for addressing global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and cyber security. Creating institutions like a World Data Organization that coordinate a consistent approach towards data can complement global trade organizations. Digital minilateralism involving small groups of nations can also help regulate the digital world and prevent new barriers between nations resulting from re-localized economies.

Minilateral approaches to cooperation on digital projects, including AI, are more agile and efficient than universal organizations like the UN. To close the divide between rich and poor, more players from the developing world need to participate. Cities require recognition for their growing economic and demographic power, and federal models of national politics should give more power to regions and cities to manage their own affairs, including their energy, resources, and climate agendas. This may help close the rural-urban divide and address societal divisions resulting from over-centralized government.

Cities are working together to identify shared policies through initiatives such as C40 and Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. However, current institutional arrangements are ill-equipped to deal with the terrain of exponential technologies. The re-localising effects of new technologies may lead to political and economic disorder, potentially increasing global conflict as tensions mount between urban and rural areas. Our approach to warfare is also being disrupted dramatically. The text then presents a case study of Estonia in 2007, when tensions between its Russian minority and authorities led to crisis.

Estonia's decision to relocate a Soviet-era statue caused riots among Russians in Estonia, followed by a successful cyberattack on the country's entire infrastructure, including media, banking, and government services. The attack was compounded by a wave of misinformation from pro-Russian hackers. Estonia disconnected from the global internet to end the attack, and the culprit(s) remains unclear, with many officials blaming the Kremlin.

The cyberattack on Estonia in 2007 was orchestrated by the Kremlin, and while Estonia is a member of NATO, the alliance's response was uncertain because there was no clear evidence that the attack was from the Russian state, and it was not clear whether cyberattacks were covered by Article 5 of the NATO treaty. The attack demonstrated the power of cyberattacks and presaged the future of conflict, where the cost of building certain types of weapons is declining, making malicious forms of attack more feasible and cheaper than their twentieth-century predecessors, putting the attacker out of harm's way.

As more digital devices are connected to the internet, the attack surface for potential cyberattacks expands, making individuals and businesses more vulnerable. This is due to the proliferation of smart devices and misinformation-prone social networks. In the Exponential Age, traditional security measures are becoming increasingly feeble against modern military technologies, leading to an exponential gap. This creates new opportunities for adversaries and challenges in attenuating conflicts and reducing risks.

As new forms of digital warfare emerge, traditional defense methods struggle to keep up, creating a gap between the capabilities of modern militaries and the threats they face. This gap also includes the absence of protocols and laws governing digital warfare, including rules of engagement and responses to cyberattacks. The political instability and potential decrease in global trade also create concerns for future conflicts. Despite the historical belief that trade promotes peace, the growing interdependence between nations is being challenged.

Increasing bilateral trade interdependence and global trade openness significantly reduce the probability of military conflict between countries, and the turn against globalization may lead to greater conflict. Conflicts within nations are becoming more common, with new wars led by non-state actors and driven by religious and cultural identities. These conflicts are more likely to occur within countries than between them, and their number has doubled in the last decade. Exponential technologies have contributed to this shift, along with growing urban-rural divides, the increasing weakness of intergovernmental bodies, and declining costs.

The changing landscape of warfare, including the development of military technology, is drawing non-state actors into conflicts. The next few decades could see a constant era of conflict, which will make nations' ability to defend themselves more fragile as economic and political instability increases. The changing nature of warfare is also illustrated by the example of Operation Opera, a risky mission carried out by Israeli Air Forces in 1981 to destroy the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq.

Israel used a squadron to destroy Iraq's nuclear reactor 40 years ago. Today, Israel's focus has shifted to Iran's nuclear ambitions, and they are using a different approach. Stuxnet, a malicious software code, was designed to target Iranian nuclear sites and damage delicate centrifuges without a kinetic attack. It is widely believed to be a joint creation of the Israeli and US governments. As everything is becoming digitized, the number of attack surfaces within governments is increasing, including nuclear reactors and military databases.

Millions of civilian-targeted cyberattacks occur daily, with 96% of British businesses experiencing damaging cyberattacks in 2019. Data leaks are a common consequence, with over 37 billion data records leaked worldwide in 2020. Most people lack the ability to protect themselves from cyberattacks, and new attack surfaces lead to new attack methods. Hackers can now spoof global positioning systems and target civilian networks, which can be catastrophic. For instance, in 2017, a group of Russian agents launched an operation to debilitate Ukraine's banking system using malware.

The NotPetya malware attack in Ukraine successfully hit global companies, causing billions of dollars of damage and fundamentally changing contemporary warfare. North Korea's previously insular regime has now become involved in cyber warfare, with its cyber army directly under Kim Jong-un's command involved in illegal state activities that have raised up to $2 billion for the country's weapons programs.

The use of cyberattacks by nations, such as North Korea and Iran, allows relatively poor nations to have a disproportionately impactful foreign policy. Cyber warfare creates a different world of conflict with new targets, forms of attack, and hostile actors. However, traditional concepts of sovereignty and war and peace developed over centuries are not equipped to regulate a world where thousands of actors seek to wreak havoc through digital subterfuge without any official acknowledgment.

Sandworm, an alleged entity part of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), has been responsible for various cyber attacks, including NotPetya and interference in American elections, as well as the downing of a Malaysian plane and a failed assassination attempt in the UK. Sandworm's motives appear to be to create chaos, rather than to achieve clear strategic objectives. The inadequacy of our rules-based order is compounded by the inadequacy of existing forms of national defense against cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the case of Maersk, a Danish company that was crippled by Sandworm's attack, but was ultimately saved by its own IT staff. Most nations' cyber defenses remain weak, and private security researchers often come to the rescue, rather than the military or police.

Defensive capabilities against cyber attacks have proven to be limited and outlaws, acting on their own or at the behest of a state, appeared powerful. The US adopted a principle of defending forward in 2018 and Britain launched its own National Cyber Force in 2020. In 2020, the American government discovered that SolarWinds had been the victim of a cyberattack that had gone undetected for months. Fake news factories emerged in Veles, North Macedonia, in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016, with local teens enlisted to create or rewrite right-wing news stories published on social media, which were wildly popular and profitable.

The Exponential Age has made it easier for viral misinformation to be produced and shared, leading to a growing number of attack surfaces. The use of misinformation to influence national politics was once fanciful, but it has become a tangible problem that can achieve its aim with just the belief of members of the global public. In the early years of social media, coordinated misinformation was rare, but it has grown rapidly since then.

False claims on Twitter rose significantly from 2012 to 2016, spreading six times faster than the truth. The Exponential Age facilitates the spread of misinformation through new information networks, viral network effects, and AI, making it easier for lies to spread. Fake news is prevalent globally, and it is created for profit or orchestrated by nation-states seeking an advantage over adversaries. Social networks during the 2020 US election became breeding grounds for conspiracies, including those about vaccines and the origins of Covid-19, fueled by President Trump's tweets.

Misinformation is increasingly being used as a type of hostile military action by states. 28 countries had undertaken online disinformation operations in 2017, rising to 70 in 2019. Russia was responsible for 72% of foreign disinformation operations between 2013 and 2019, but China has also been using large-scale misinformation operations in the Asia-Pacific. When used by states, misinformation becomes disinformation which is actively malicious. Disinformation campaigns can have harmful real-world impacts, such as in Iran where 700 people may have died from methanol poisoning following online rumors about COVID-19.

The pandemic has been used as an opportunity to weaponize pre-existing divisions in the US through disinformation campaigns to delegitimize efforts to control the spread of the disease and vaccination. Governments have been slow to take responsibility in countering misinformation, and physical warfare is still a possibility despite the rise of cyberattacks and disinformation. The declining prices of weaponry have catalyzed conflict and led to a more multifaceted form of warfare fought simultaneously in private forums, public life, and streets.

Drones were initially used in limited military exercises until the War on Terror, when the CIA began using them to hunt down al-Qaeda leaders. The US military's Predator drone has since been used extensively in the Middle East, with President Obama launching 542 drone attacks during his time in office. Consumer drone technology has rapidly developed thanks to advances in microchips, batteries, robotics, and AI, making drones cheaper and more widely available. By the early 2020s, drones were cheap enough to be used in public events in place of fireworks.

Advancements in drone technology have led to both expensive, sophisticated military drones and cheap, accessible drones that have allowed new actors to enter conflicts. This has led to an increase in asymmetric conflicts and exacerbated conflicts between nation-states. Cheap drones have been used by terrorist groups and small states to conduct attacks, while more established actors also rely on drone warfare. The development of drones has changed the nature of modern military conflicts.

Azerbaijan's use of advanced drones with close links to Turkey and Israel gave them an upper hand in the conflict with Armenia, resulting in heavy losses for the Armenians. This conflict highlighted the vulnerability of traditional men-and-materiel approach to low-cost exponential technologies, leading to a realization that cheaper armed drones were needed. Drones are agile, can access hard-to-reach areas, and have the potential to improve accuracy, act as decoys, and confuse enemy radars. However, they also raise concerns about the likelihood of illegal forms of warfare, such as chemical warfare, becoming more tempting for some nations due to increased reliability and precision.

The exponential transformation of drones is still ongoing, with a move towards autonomous systems that can engage the enemy without human intervention. The development of facial recognition and computer vision adds to the power of such technology on the battlefield. High degrees of autonomy are becoming more commonplace and over one-third of weapons systems with automated-targeting capabilities can select and attack targets without human intervention. In the near future, autonomous systems could undertake complex and coordinated actions faster and more agile than humans, potentially eliminating communication delays.

The use of fully autonomous weapons systems poses ethical and legal concerns as it would allow machines to make decisions about attacking and killing without human intervention. The lack of clarity on who is responsible for crimes arising from the use of autonomous weapons poses a responsibility gap. The exponential world of warfare is disorderly and cheap, allowing for a range of attacks with little risk to soldiers. The absence of clear regulations surrounding autonomous warfare creates uncertainty around the culpability of individuals and organizations.

The combination of new technology and political instability is likely to lead to an era of continuous conflict, where any small-scale skirmish could escalate into a larger disaster. To escape this world of high-tech conflict, states need to strengthen their defenses, establish new norms surrounding communication and escalation, and work to reduce the proliferation of attack surfaces and weapons. Western states' defenses against high-tech attacks are often weak, and the right investments could strengthen them. Establishing new norms for communication and reducing attack surfaces and weapons are also necessary for resolving conflicts in the Exponential Age.

- Rebalancing military priorities to focus on cyberattacks as a real threat. - Expensive planes like the F-35 may not be the best investment for defense. - US Department of Defense updated its policy to defend forward and strengthen Cyber Command's role. - Defending against cyberattacks also involves private companies that own and run much of the digital infrastructure. - Private corporations are often responsible for identifying, responding to, and recovering from attacks. - Increasing public accountability of massive companies could boost their security and help prevent attacks. - Microsoft's Digital Geneva Convention initiative aims to protect civilians from cyberattacks.

- The Digital Geneva Convention aims to engage governments and private companies in protecting civilian security in times of conflict. - Digital literacy is essential for citizens to operate safely in the digital world and prevent attacks. - Digital hygiene and media literacy are important aspects of digital literacy. - Finland and Taiwan are leading the way in promoting digital literacy and critical thinking skills to combat disinformation and fake news.

Taiwan's digital minister, Audrey Tang, emphasizes the importance of teaching media competence to produce data and narratives, rather than just being readers and viewers. While stronger defenses are crucial, de-escalation tactics and effective communication are also necessary to reduce the likelihood of attacks and prevent them from spiraling out of control. Policymakers can learn from the communication tactics adopted during the Cold War and establish a similar network of communication fit for the digital age to prevent confusion and escalation caused by cyberattacks.

New rules of engagement and methods of escalation and de-escalation are urgently needed to mitigate the risks of cyber conflict, as the rules in this young domain are evolving at different rates among different adversaries. The less hawkish policymakers of the Cold War offer guidance for establishing clear norms and doctrines to prevent conflicts from escalating accidentally. Non-proliferation treaties fit for the digital age could be used to ban certain types of cyberattacks, such as commercially available hacking software, to prevent them from falling into the hands of non-state actors or national armies.

The NSO Group's software Pegasus has been used as spyware by malicious actors, and a legal framework is needed to govern the use of autonomous weapons. The consensus is that human control must remain an important aspect of weapons design, operation, and governance. Exponential technologies will drive further conflict, and without new systems of defense and de-escalation, the world risks becoming a sprawling, messy battlefield. The primary goal of any sovereign nation is to protect its citizens from violent threats, but this raises questions about life at home.

Exponential technology is unsettling other areas of our lives beyond conflict, such as the relationship between consumer and market and citizen and society. A famous anti-war photo was removed from Facebook for breaching its policies on child pornography, causing controversy and a public outcry. Eventually, the decision was reversed.

Facebook's power over our public sphere became apparent during controversies over Russian interference in the US election and questions about censorship. Mark Zuckerberg has near-absolute control over Facebook and its subsidiaries due to his voting shares, including configuring algorithms and setting rules for speech. This highlights the disruption of exponential technologies on the relationship between citizens and society.

There are ethical limits to what can be bought and sold, and democratic institutions like Congress and public service broadcasters should not be subject to the market. However, in the Exponential Age, private companies with increasing returns to scale are encroaching on these areas, leading to the emergence of private rule-makers and the privatization of the public sphere. This is a phenomenon with three key features, including the power of private companies verging on monopoly and expanding into ever-wider sectors of society.

The article highlights three concerning trends related to the increasing dominance of private organizations in our lives: 1) private organizations are making laws that govern our lives, replacing elected officials; 2) private companies are increasingly monitoring and claiming ownership of personal information about our lives, sold for profit; 3) the way we interact with one another is being privatized, with public conversations happening on a limited number of private platforms. These trends have significant implications for our democracy, privacy, and social relationships.

The article discusses how the private sector is dominating and remolding our personal relationships through a small number of oligopolistic companies, potentially leading to an increasingly divided society. The decisions made by these technology executives often prioritize their businesses over the needs of society, causing harmful effects. As companies get bigger, they will continue to encroach into previously non-market realms, fundamentally rewiring the relationship between citizens and society. The article also discusses how the early ideals of the internet inadvertently handed power to those who knew how to code and could harness the power of the web for their own purposes.

In his essay "Code is Law," Lawrence Lessig argues that code, the instructions that make up software, can become a constraint on our behavior in the digital realm. Coders have untold power to choose how the code regulates, and thus determine how values regulate in cyberspace. If we don't collectively scrutinize the interests of developers, they will become the rule-makers of the digital world. In fact, big and ruthless corporations are now determining the laws, making them more unaccountable than even Lessig predicted.

The power of coders and executives in shaping software code has implications for the public sphere. Private actors, such as tech companies, are becoming rule-makers, altering what can and cannot be done. Facebook's success and standardization of relationship status questions have led to exporting particular sociocultural qualities to societies where they may not be appropriate. The growing power of private actors in making rules also affects what ideas can get into the public conversation, as tech companies become the censors.

The article discusses how software code can become law, as seen in the case of contact tracing apps during the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple and Google updated their operating systems to allow for easier development of these apps while prioritizing user privacy over government surveillance. This highlights the power of tech companies in determining what governments and scientists can and cannot do, creating a system of arbitrary power without clear accountability.

The article discusses the concentration of power in the hands of a few technology executives who control what enters the public sphere. While the internet has allowed for greater public participation, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter dominate political conversations and have the power to censor or promote content based on their own motives. This concentration of power raises concerns about censorship and its impact on society. The article cites examples such as the removal of a photo from Facebook and the spread of viral messages on WhatsApp leading to violence in India.

The root problem of social media is the lack of accountability, as companies decide what ideas get circulated. Facebook's actions in response to violence in India and Myanmar were deemed appropriate, but they also allowed hate speech and threats to remain on the platform. Social media platforms often make arbitrary distinctions between acceptable and unacceptable speech, as evidenced by the banning of Donald Trump's accounts.

Trump had a history of promoting racist conspiracy theories and spreading false information on social media. The social media bans raised questions about the power of these platforms to control public conversation and whether private companies should be responsible for censorship. Some companies are experimenting with new approaches, such as Facebook's Oversight Board, but without clear guidance from policymakers, Exponential Age companies have made up their own rules. There is a need for democratically accountable frameworks to govern these decisions.

In the Exponential Age, our digital selves are constructed from our online data, which has been privatized by businesses that use it for advertising and other purposes. Privacy is power, as personal details can be transformed into economic, political and other forms of power. The GDPR considers each of us to be data subjects, but we have also become subjects of data. Companies use our data to profit, track, and potentially control us. User tracking has become more complicated over time.

In the mid-1990s, user tracking on websites was limited and basic, and was only used for system debugging. With the introduction of Google's AdWords in 2000, businesses began to gather more data about user behavior to profit from advertising. This led to the value of gathering individual data becoming clear, and many companies began to track user behavior in innovative and unscrupulous ways. As a result, a user visiting a few websites could be tracked by hundreds of organizations, gathering information like location, IP address, and search history.

The world is awash with data as digital technologies generate about 2.4 megabytes of data per human every minute, with 18 million gigabytes added to the data sphere per minute. Facebook and other companies collect vast amounts of personal information, often without the user's knowledge or consent, and store it due to the declining cost of storage. New technologies such as brain-computing interfaces and sensors in homes and environments will generate even more data about individuals.

Data collection has many beneficial effects, as it can be used to accurately predict outcomes such as disease risk or financial health. Credit bureaux gather data from banks and utilities to create credit scores, which help people access financial services. However, inaccurate data and data breaches can result in unfair credit scores. The risks of data collection extend beyond credit data, with companies such as 23andMe offering gene sequencing services that may reveal personal information.

23andMe, a popular genetic testing service, has amassed a large amount of genomic data from millions of users who have consented to have their data used for research. However, 23andMe can sell this data, as demonstrated by their $300 million deal with GlaxoSmithKline in 2018, and there are no laws like HIPAA to protect genetic data. Without proper protections, personal data can be used to stigmatize and profile individuals, as seen in China's social credit system.

Social credit scores based on data could help overcome a crisis of trust, but the implications of digitally generated citizen taxonomy are dystopian. Companies use data to profile individuals and make decisions about loans and insurance, leading to demographic profiling and racial biases. As companies sell personal information for profit, private data is used to manipulate individuals.

Homophily, the tendency to group with people who are similar to us, can make life easier but can also lead to a divided society, making it harder to reach consensus decisions and govern effectively. This phenomenon, called pernicious polarization, can erode the ability of a democracy to function. In the Exponential Age, where communities are increasingly formed online, homophily is at risk of spiraling out of control when our social bonds are formed solely through digital platforms. This poses a problem for citizens as it subordinates public conversation and private lives to the logic of the market.

Online networks are more homophilous and clustered than the rest of society, as social networks link people with common traits and interests for commercial incentives. This grouping can push people into ever more isolated and extreme groups due to algorithms promoting increasingly borderline and extreme material to keep users on the website. YouTube, in particular, may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century. Studies show that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content, and users who consume extreme content used to consume milder content but gradually shifted to the extreme.

A report from 2018 found that Facebook inadvertently created a system that helps connect extremists and terrorists, leading to recruitment and radicalization. Facebook's algorithms exploit the human brain's attraction to divisiveness, and the platform has recognized the scale of the issue and launched an initiative to tackle it. Right-wing and racist extremism is rife on Facebook, and 64% of people who joined extremist groups did so due to Facebook's recommendation tools.

Exponential technologies like gene editing could exacerbate the problem of homophily, leading to the erosion of societal ideals and the stratification of communities. Homophily divides people into smaller, more extreme groups and builds walls instead of bridges. This is the era of the second enclosure, where new spheres of life are being commodified and covered with property rights, potentially leading to the rich robbing the poor of their share of the common.

Private platforms dominate our public conversation and personal information is bought and sold for profit, making it difficult to hold corporations accountable. The data economies of the Exponential Age are radicalizing and dividing society, limiting democratic institutions. New rules need to be established through democratic politics to ensure corporations do not monopolize discussions on the internet. Transparency is needed for digital networks to observe how content flows and make informed decisions. Broad principles should be established to underpin the relationship between citizens and the market.

Tech elites make opaque decisions that affect content moderation on social platforms. Clear and explicit rules need to be established regarding acceptable forms of speech. Oversight by external parties is necessary to inspect potential harms brought about by algorithms and digital networks. Regular inspection should be conducted behind open doors instead of closed doors to ensure safety. This approach is already present in other sectors.

The article proposes two principles for regulating digital platforms: external oversight and interoperability. External oversight would involve independent parties overseeing the decision-making processes of tech elites and the operation of algorithms. Interoperability would allow users to access and carry their data across different platforms, promoting competition and giving users more choice. The article suggests that until 2016, digital platforms were more open and interoperable, but have since become more closed and walled off.

The dominant social networks stifled interoperability, making their systems deliberately incompatible. Interoperability redresses the power imbalance between large platform companies and individuals, as it limits the sites' power over users. Interoperability is technologically possible, but governments need to mandate it for services that reach a certain size, perhaps 10-15% market share.

Interoperability, or the ability to share data across platforms, can shift power to individuals from tech giants. Data ownership is a topic of debate, with some suggesting treating data as property and compensating individuals for it. However, monetizing personal data could exacerbate the problem of commercializing private life on digital platforms.

Personal data is worth little and monetizing it would further commercialize private life. Instead, individuals need new rights for their data selves, including control over their data and protection against surveillance, manipulation, and discrimination. Sharing the benefits of data in aggregate can be useful for improving cities, healthcare, and more. A digital bill of rights may be insufficient and a more proactive approach is needed to rewire the relationship between citizens and the market.

Organizing shared data in a way that benefits society without exacerbating data misuse requires a fundamental reappraisal of the market/state binary. This dichotomy conceals other productive ways of organizing resources, including the commons, which can be well-stewarded without privatizing or nationalizing them, as demonstrated by Nobel Prize-winning political economist Elinor Ostrom.

The commons, a system of shared resources governed by formal and informal norms, can be well-stewarded without privatization or nationalization, and can benefit those who use them. Creating digital data commons can prevent the growing power of the private sector and allow for trusted collective use of certain types of information resources for our benefit, as demonstrated by the UK Biobank.

The article discusses the concept of commons-based peer production, where resources are shared and managed collectively by volunteers. Examples include open-source software and Wikipedia. This approach can be more successful than commercial ones and presents a new way of thinking about the relationship between citizen and market, responding to the challenge of digital infrastructure in modern society. Four key principles - transparency, interoperability, rights, and commons - underpin this approach.

The article argues that the unchecked power of private firms threatens our status as citizens and reinforces the need for accountability and good governance. The Exponential Age exacerbates these issues by concentrating power in the hands of a few companies. To address this, power should be returned to the people, with citizens acting in their collective interest. The article concludes with an example of open-access research in virology as a model for abundance and equity.



Scientists worldwide quickly downloaded the sequence of the coronavirus and started developing vaccines when the virus spread and governments panicked. 

Moderna produced the first vials of their vaccine 31 days after the virus sequence was released and manufactured it within 25 days. 

Within a year of the virus being identified, seven effective vaccines were approved and nearly 24 million people had received a vaccine shot. 

The speed at which scientists developed the vaccine was unprecedented in human history, with vaccines for other diseases taking much longer. 

The global crisis caused by COVID-19 led to the rapid development of the vaccine, as the disease spread rapidly and caused millions of deaths within a year.



COVID-19 caused a global pandemic resulting in millions of deaths and economic turmoil with lockdowns implemented globally. 

However, the response to COVID-19 was unprecedented in speed and efficacy, thanks to transformative technologies at every stage of the process. 

Genome sequencers allowed for rapid analysis of COVID-19, and Moderna used modified mRNA and machine learning to design its vaccine quickly. 

Machine learning allows for a virtuous cycle of collecting data to build better algorithms and medication. 

The exponential process of technology underpins the success of the vaccine development.

Technology played a critical role during the pandemic by compressing tasks that usually take years to just hours, enabling the recruitment of large numbers of trial candidates, speeding up vaccination rates, and fighting online misinformation. Exponential technologies defined cultural and social responses to the pandemic, and Covid misinformation spread rapidly on different social networks. During lockdowns, technology provided creature comforts such as Netflix, online games, and online grocery delivery.

The Covid pandemic accelerated the adoption of exponential technologies such as videoconferencing, online streaming, and e-commerce, which became lifelines for many during lockdowns. These technologies were less than a decade old and were made possible by improvements in computational power, cheaper energy, and increased production efficiency. The pandemic highlighted the transformative power of exponential technologies and the continued potential for technological advancement.

The Exponential Age is expected to continue its upward trajectory as technological and social transformations accelerate. Predicting the long-term implications of exponential technologies is difficult, but it is expected that computer power will become 100 times cheaper in a decade. It is hard to imagine the implications of this growth in computing power, just as it was hard to imagine the comforts of today's world in the early days of electricity.

Renewable energy will become dominant and cheaper, while fossil fuels will decline. Synthetic biology will provide alternatives to fossil fuels. Human genome sequencing will become affordable and common for medical procedures. Wearable devices and regular testing could catch health conditions early. Nanosatellites will provide real-time data to monitor natural resources, including forests and coral reefs. Scientists plan to map and track all 3 trillion trees on the planet to understand deforestation rates.

Exponential technologies are creating an age of abundance where energy, food, computation, and more are cheap to produce, but an abundance of resources does not mean an absence of waste. Technology alone cannot solve our problems, and without proper governance, exponential technologies may lead to increased resource consumption and environmental harm. Vertical farming is an example of a technology that could reduce resource dependence while providing nutritious food to cities.



 Overconsumption and environmental catastrophe are issues of concern. 

 Technology's exponential rates of improvement and deployment challenge established systems and have a significant impact on social, economic, and political institutions, disproportionately affecting smaller, vulnerable, and low-tech companies and workers with lower levels of training. 

 Exponential technologies contribute to the creation of superstar companies and the shift in the locus of power towards individuals and places such as high-tech knowledge-workers, cyber criminals, and malevolent states. 

 The notion of the exponential gap attempts to synthesize these forces, all of which hint at a world changing faster than our systems and assumptions can handle, leading us towards a dystopian future.

The article argues that the dystopian world caused by environmental crisis is not inevitable and that technology's shape, direction, and impact are not preordained. Sheila Jasanoff, an ethicist at Harvard, critiques the notion that technology has an unstoppable momentum, reshaping society to fit its demands. The solution to the exponential gap is a shift in mindset that acknowledges that we have agency over where technology will take us. The first stage of this shift is to recognize that we are the ones who decide what we want from the tools we build. The article uses DDT and gig work to show how different societies use technology in divergent ways.

The article highlights that our choices and circumstances determine how technology is used and that technology is neither good, nor bad, nor neutral. The second stage of the shift in mindset involves accepting that technology will bring rapid, often unexpected dislocations and channeling them when possible. Technology disrupts the unspoken rules, norms, values, and expectations that bind our societies together. While we cannot prevent this molding, we can direct it. However, changing the pace of change alone will not close the exponential gap, and we need policies, social movements, and new forms of political and economic organization to do so.



 Exponential technology is impacting our politics, economy, and society. 

 The modern economy is dominated by large companies, sometimes with monopoly power, and new regulatory and societal expectations are needed. 

 Platforms are eroding traditional employer-employee relationships, and new forms of collective action are needed to empower workers. 

 Re-localization of supply chains is changing our sense of place, with cities growing in importance and rural areas at risk of being left behind. 

 Issues that were once thought of as national are becoming more regional or even local.



 The structure of power within and between nations needs to change to reflect the impact of exponential technology. 

 New organizations are needed to maintain international cooperation and prevent exclusion from its benefits. 

 The return to the local could lead to conflict, and nations need to strengthen their defenses and develop new rules and norms of war. 

 The relationship between citizen and society needs to be rethought to ensure certain areas fall beyond the remit of markets. 

 Common ownership and control could allow communities to harness the power of exponential technology. 

 Unifying themes include commonality, adaptability, and responsibility in managing the phase transition into the Exponential Age.

The need to build institutions for cooperation and resilience in the face of rapid change is emphasized in the book. Interoperability encourages businesses to work together, while cooperation between nations can reduce global conflict. Worker collectives and commons approaches to data are also important. Resilient institutions are needed to handle constant change, with new forms of welfare and digital rights providing basic protections. Flexibility is also necessary to quickly adapt to changing society. All organizations must consider developing sturdy systems with resilience and flexibility in mind.

The book emphasizes the need for institutions to adapt more quickly to the changing technological order. Power to the local level and increased transparency in big tech can help institutions become more agile and respond to problems quickly. The Exponential Age requires flexibility, and institutions must be serious about it to keep up. The gradual pace of change in institutions was fine in response to technologies of the industrial age, but now a new social settlement is needed for the era of constant change. The principles of commonality, resilience, and flexibility are essential for institutions to function in this age.

The Exponential Age is characterized by unpredictable technological innovation that constantly interacts with society's approaches to various domains, but humans have historically found ways to thrive and control technology. Technology, no matter how sophisticated, has the potential to be a force for good.
