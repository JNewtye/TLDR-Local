 The text is a book titled "Corruptible: Who Gets Power and How It Changes Us" by Brian Klaas. 

 The book consists of 13 chapters and includes acknowledgments, notes, and an index. 

 The chapters cover topics such as the evolution of power, why power corrupts, how power changes the body, and attracting the incorruptible. 

 The book examines why certain people and systems are more susceptible to corruption by power.

The book "Corruptible" by Brian Klaas explores how power corrupts individuals and shapes the modern world. The book is praised for its passionate and insightful analysis, offering a roadmap for navigating a world full of illiberal democracies, modernized dictatorships, and power-hungry populists. The introduction poses questions about the nature of corruption and power, which can be answered by looking at the experiences of two forgotten islands.

Beacon Island off the western coast of Australia, seemingly unremarkable, holds a secret. In 1628, the Batavia, a spice ship owned by the Dutch East India Company, set sail with 340 people on board, including a psychopathic pharmacist and a junior merchant named Jeronimus Cornelisz, who plotted a mutiny to take control of the ship and its silver coins. However, the plan did not go according to plan, and on June 4, 1629, the ship ran aground on a reef near Beacon Island, leading to a brutal massacre and an unlikely hero.

The Batavia ship crashed into a coral reef, leaving survivors stranded on barren islands with little resources. The captain and a group set off to get help, leaving others behind. A would-be mutineer, Cornelisz, survived the ship's sinking and became the leader of the remaining men. After nine days, the ship broke apart, and some men drowned, while Cornelisz floated to Beacon Island. Despite being weak, Cornelisz's status as an officer meant he became the leader again.

Cornelisz, the leader of the survivors on Beacon Island, consolidated power by eliminating rivals and ordering gruesome executions. He dressed in fine clothing while others wore rags and waited to be killed. More than a hundred people were killed before a rescue mission arrived. Cornelisz was sentenced to death and hanged. The episode raises the question of whether the massacres would have been avoided without Cornelisz.

Six teenagers ran away from their boarding school, stole a fishing boat and were adrift at sea for eight days with no way to steer or navigate. They eventually spotted Ata, an island covered with vegetation, and swam to shore. They survived by trapping seabirds and drinking their blood, then later upgrading to coconut juice. They learned to start a fire and cook their food, and worked together to collect fresh water by tapping into tree roots and collecting rainwater.

Six castaway teenagers worked together to survive on a deserted island, sharing tasks and resources equally without a leader. They built a primitive house, had occasional disputes but would move apart to cool down, and settled in for the long haul. They limited their consumption of seabirds, planted wild beans, and engaged in various activities to pass the time. Fifteen months later, they were rescued by an Australian fisherman who spotted them on the island.

In 1966, six Tongan teenagers were stranded on a deserted island for fifteen months, assumed dead by their families and country. They survived through cooperation and loyalty, in contrast to the violence and exploitation of the boys in Lord of the Flies. Their rescue is a testament to the strength of human connection and the importance of structure and order.

The conflicting tales of the Tongan teenagers and the boys in Lord of the Flies raise questions about the nature of power and hierarchy. The author, a political scientist, has studied bad people in positions of power across the globe to understand what makes them tick and how to stop them. The book seeks to answer four questions: Do worse people get power? Does power make people worse? Why do we allow unfit people to control us? How can we ensure that good people are in power? The author's research has revealed that those who abuse power come in different forms, but they all wield enormous power.

The author questions whether those in power become "monsters" or if there are "monsters" among us all. They suggest that the conventional wisdom that power corrupts may not be entirely accurate, and they share their experience meeting a corrupt politician in Madagascar. The author believes that solving this puzzle is urgent in order to reduce abuses of power in society.

The article tells the story of Marc Ravalomanana, who started as a poor boy in Madagascar and became a successful yogurt businessman, then president of the country. Initially, Ravalomanana delivered on his promises of change, but his government eventually became corrupt and oppressive. The author visits Ravalomanana at his palace, where he shows off his opulence and devotion to Jesus, highlighting the contrast between his humble beginnings and current power.

The author visits Madagascar to study Ravalomanana and forgets his pen, but Ravalomanana summons two employees to bring them new pens. Ravalomanana asks for campaign advice for the upcoming presidential election and the author suggests a gimmick of visiting all districts in 119 days while riding a bicycle to promote his rags-to-riches image. Ravalomanana agrees and orders the purchase of 119 bicycles. Ravalomanana has a history of winning elections with unconventional tactics and rigging the 2006 election.

Ravalomanana used unconventional tactics to win elections, including blocking his main opponent from returning to Madagascar to register for candidacy, which led to his victory. However, after six years in power, his corruption grew worse, including using state funds to buy a presidential aircraft and trying to license it to himself. In 2009, protests against Ravalomanana turned violent, resulting in a military coup that toppled him from power. The author questions whether power corrupts individuals, including Ravalomanana and the radio DJ who replaced him.

The notion that power corrupts people may not be entirely accurate. The infamous Stanford Prison Experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, which is often cited as evidence of the corrupting influence of power, has been misunderstood. Zimbardo randomly assigned nine college students as guards and nine as prisoners in a fake jail he built in the basement of the Stanford psychology department. The guards quickly became abusive towards the prisoners, while the latter became submissive. However, recent analyses have suggested that the study was flawed, and the participants were influenced by demand characteristics and socialization rather than by the power dynamic. Therefore, it may not be power itself that corrupts individuals but the types of people who are attracted to it.

The Stanford Prison Experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, which suggests that power corrupts individuals, has been criticized for its flawed methodology and questionable conclusions. Only some guards were abusive, while others resisted and treated the prisoners with respect. Some participants claimed to have been performing for the researchers. The experiment's recruitment process was not considered, and the demand characteristics and socialization of the participants were not taken into account. Therefore, the study's narrative is murkier than previously believed, and the conclusion that power corrupts individuals may not be entirely accurate. However, the experiment still highlights how ordinary people can become cruel and depraved under certain conditions.

In 2007, researchers replicated an ad for a psychological study of prison life but changed the amount of compensation and the wording to refer to a generic study. Those who responded to the prison life ad scored higher on measures of aggressiveness, authoritarianism, Machiavellianism, narcissism, and social dominance, and lower on empathy and altruism. This challenges the conclusion of the Stanford Prison Experiment, suggesting that sadistic people seek out power rather than power corrupting good people.

Even if bad people are drawn to power, there's still a mystery as to why they attain it so easily. A 2008 Swiss experiment tested the hypothesis that humans are somehow drawn to giving power to the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Children and adults accurately identified election winners based on faces alone, highlighting how easily influenced we are by appearances when choosing leaders.

Assessments of leadership potential are often superficial, and studies have shown that people who are aggressive or rude are perceived as more powerful and leader-like than those who are cooperative. The allure of power and the effects of being in charge may depend on the context and system, as some people in positions of authority are genuinely helpful. However, systems can be changed, as seen in a study in Bangalore where efforts were made to attract honest people to government careers.

In an experiment, university students were asked to roll dice and self-report the results to earn off-the-books pay. Those who cheated were more likely to aspire to join India's corrupt civil service, while those who reported scores honestly were more likely to aspire to be civil servants in Denmark, where the system is clean and transparent. The study suggests that a good system can attract ethical power seekers while a bad system can create a vicious cycle of dishonesty. The focus should be on repairing broken systems rather than powerful individuals.

The text explores possible solutions to the question of why power corrupts, including the idea that power attracts corruptible individuals and bad leaders are selected for irrational reasons. The focus on individuals in power is a mistake because bad systems produce bad leaders. The book aims to provide answers to fundamental questions about human society. Before delving into questions of power, the text considers why hierarchies exist in human societies.

The text explores the concept of a society without hierarchy and suggests that such a society was the norm for humans for most of our existence on the planet. To understand our present, we must travel back in time to our common ancestor, LUCA, and our chimpanzee-human last common ancestor (CHLCA). Despite millions of years of evolution, we remain closely related to chimpanzees, sharing 98.8 percent of our DNA with them.

Humans share DNA with dogs and bananas, but similarities with chimpanzees present a hypothesis that we can understand ourselves by studying them. However, the law of the jungle does not explain complex human social structures. Chimpanzee hierarchies are more sophisticated than previously known, requiring alliances, favor currying, and resource distribution. Frans de Waal's book "Chimpanzee Politics" ascribed intentionality and strategic social planning to animals and showed that weak chimps could form pacts to offset the power of strong chimps.

Chimpanzees are constantly vying for power and status, with hierarchy being inescapable. De Waal's observations showed that some chimps relentlessly pursue power while others are content with lower positions. This complexity in chimp behavior is similar to that of humans seeking, getting, and wielding power. However, despite our genetic similarities with chimpanzees, human behavior is not entirely predetermined by genetics.

Around 15 million letters in human DNA differ from chimpanzee DNA, but not all of them are important for our biology. Katherine Pollard identified the parts of the genome that changed the most over millions of years and found that major changes were selected because they helped our quasi-human ancestors survive. Pollard pinpointed 118 bases of DNA that combine to form something called HAR1, which represents millions of years of genetic divergence between humans and chimpanzees.

The Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1) is crucial for proper brain development and its dysfunction can lead to deadly degeneration. Michael Tomasello's study on toddlers suggests that humans have an innate sense of fairness and justice. In the study, toddlers were given rewards unequally, and in the third version where they worked together equally but still received unequal rewards, some children shared their rewards, indicating a sense of fairness. This suggests that humans have a preoccupation with fairness and equality that is not present in chimpanzees.

In a study, 80% of three-year-olds shared their reward equally with an unlucky companion after cooperating, indicating a sense of fairness. This sharing impulse may be learned or a result of social pressure, but it is less influenced by social stigma in toddlers. The act of collaboration may engender a sense of "we" and lead children to see their partner as equally deserving of the spoils. This instinct may have evolved uniquely in humans, as chimpanzees did not exhibit the same sharing behavior in the same experiment.

Humans evolved from chimpanzees but developed a sense that cooperation should be rewarded with equal spoils, unlike chimpanzees who rely on dominance. The egalitarian impulse characterized humans for most of our time on earth, and the hunting ritual of the !Kung in Africa's Kalahari Desert provides insight into this impulse. The !Kung's custom of insulting the meat of successful hunters serves to cut them down to size and prevent them from becoming chiefs or big men who view others as inferiors. This egalitarian instinct may have evolved due to the unique shape of human shoulders that enabled throwing and cooperative hunting.

The !Kung hunter-gatherer society in Africa practices social engineering to prevent individuals from dominating and to ensure equal credit for feeding the community. The use of insulting language and randomization of credit through arrowheads prevents the emergence of leaders and maintains a flat social structure. While dominance is part of human nature, attempts to seize power within the !Kung community are met with ostracism, ridicule, humiliation, or even death. This non-hierarchical structure is more common in human history than complex civilizations with dominance and despotism.

Humans' ability to throw objects with speed and accuracy, which evolved around 2 million years ago, gave them an advantage in hunting and warfare. The use of ranged weapons, such as spears and bows, separated humans from other primates and allowed for the development of a more egalitarian social structure based on skill rather than physical strength. The ability to throw objects at high speeds and with precision was a crucial factor in the evolution of human societies.

The development of ranged weapons changed the traditional link between power and size, making size less important in survival of the fittest. This shift flattened hierarchies and led to greater cooperation among humans. The physical size differences between males and females are narrower in humans than in any other great ape species because of this shift. However, humans are still drawn to power, but the path to power has diverged from that of chimpanzees as taking power through physical combat is dangerous and possibly deadly.

The development of ranged weapons made it harder for bigger and physically dominant members of a group to rule. This led to the flattening of hierarchies in human society, resulting in a reverse dominance hierarchy where everyone is more or less equal. Anyone who tried to change this flat line back into a steep triangle did so at their own peril. Hunter-gatherers often had to fight to preserve this lack of hierarchy. However, many people still like having control over others, but a hierarchical society meant that only one person could be the leader, leaving almost everyone who wants power without it.

Early humans developed a way of life where nobody could be in charge, and anyone who tried to seize power would be dominated by the group. This resulted in relative equality in groups called bands, where leaders had no formal authority and decisions were made through consensus-driven deliberations. Evidence for this includes archaeological digs of burial sites, which rarely show differentiation within graves, and modern hunter-gatherer societies, which still live this way.

For most of human history, complex hierarchies were far less common than they are today, with evidence showing that nonhierarchical hunter-gatherer societies were the norm. However, our understanding of these societies is incomplete and may be overstated. While they lacked overbearing bosses and incompetent politicians, these societies were not utopian, with high infant and child mortality rates and conflicts often resulting from power-hungry individuals breaking social codes. Ostracism was a powerful deterrent, but when disputes arose, murder was frequently used to settle them.

Research shows that homicide was a common cause of death in prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies, with males who were group leaders, proficient hunters, or power-hungry individuals being the most likely troublemakers. Despite living in flat societies without hierarchy, humans eventually developed complex hierarchies, and the reasons for this change are explored by Peter Turchin, a Russian migr, who examines the emergence of tribes, chiefdoms, and states between eleven thousand and five thousand years ago.

Peter Turchin is a professor at the University of Connecticut who developed the field of cliodynamics, which combines math and data to study the evolution of societies and the origins of human hierarchies. Turchin's approach is based on the concept of multilevel selection, which explains how traits that enhance survival and reproduction are passed down through generations, while those that don't are eliminated. Turchin's interest in societal evolution was sparked by his father's experience as a dissident in the Soviet Union, and he seeks to understand how societies have developed inequality and poor governance.



 The traits that make warriors good at fighting also make them more likely to die, but bravery in combat is still prevalent due to group-level dynamics in warfare. 

 An army of brave soldiers working together has a better chance of surviving than an army of cowardly soldiers, which increases the likelihood of producing many children. 

 At the individual level, surviving warriors may have better luck at finding sexual partners. 

 The interplay between individual-level selection and group-level dynamics is complicated.



 Multilevel selection seeks to explain the survival and thriving of societies, as some ways of life are tailor-made for survival and some die out. 

 Traits, beliefs, and social systems affect which ideas, customs, and people survive into the next generation. 

 The rise of hierarchy can be traced back to the advantage of ranged weapons in warfare, which changes the dynamics of combat from one-on-one to multi-angle.

The advantage of having a larger army is greater in ranged combat than in close combat due to the math of ranged combat. A smaller army using ranged weapons can still win against a larger army equipped with swords and spears. This is relevant to understanding why hierarchy exists in society as the dynamics of warfare favor societies with more soldiers, leading to the formation of larger groups and hierarchy.

Dominance always emerges and hierarchy develops when societies join together and embrace chiefs, which is more effective in warfare. Military leaders gradually usurped more power and set themselves up as chiefs. The rise of hierarchy in human history was triggered by the First Agricultural Revolution, which led to a shift in human diet and reduced average height.

The traditional explanation for the abrupt shift to inequality is that agriculture led to excess food, which allowed some people to hoard and led to surpluses that made inequality possible. Other theories suggest that controlling land became more important with the rise of agriculture, particularly in areas with limited good farmland, leading to conflict and hierarchy. One such theory is environmental circumscription, which argues that land control was more important in areas with limited good farmland.

The evolution of human society from egalitarian bands to top-down empires may be explained by the combination of warfare and agriculture, which played significant roles in generating large, complex hierarchical societies. The shift happened rapidly over thousands of years, leading to enormous, hierarchical behemoths defined by inequality and dominance. As hierarchies became more widespread, struggles for power increased, allowing upstarts to have a real prospect of becoming part of the dominant society. The rise of agriculture and environmental circumscription also contributed to the shift towards larger, more complex societies.

Hierarchy and power are not inherently good or bad, but can be used to either facilitate cooperation or exploit and kill people. While violence and murder rates increased with the rise of hierarchical societies, modern states with the most hierarchical structures have the lowest rates of homicide. Hierarchy is a necessary tool for humans to cooperate and coordinate in large-scale societies, and can even spark innovation through competition for status.

Hierarchy is necessary for humans to live in large-scale societies, but corruptible people often seek power. The reason for this puzzle lies in statistics, history, and human behavior. Exceptions to the lack of status symbols in egalitarian societies include prehistoric burial chambers and modern criminal justice systems. The story of statistician Abraham Wald and the flamingo-obsessed president of a homeowners association in Arizona help explain why some people seek power despite being unsuited for it.

During World War II, a group of statisticians known as the Statistical Research Group (SRG) was formed at Columbia University to use statistical methods to help win the war. They were asked to identify possible improvements to the Allied fighting machine using probabilities. Every calculation they made could save or cost lives. They were able to make recommendations that led to improvements such as tweaking fuses on artillery shells and loading machine guns on fighter planes differently. One problem presented to the SRG was how to reduce losses from planes being shot down over Germany. Mathematician Abraham Wald realized that they needed to focus on the areas where the planes weren't hit, since those were likely the most vulnerable parts.

During World War II, the Statistical Research Group (SRG) was asked to determine whether extra armor should be placed on Allied airplanes in areas where they were getting shot. Mathematician Abraham Wald realized that they needed to focus on the areas where the planes weren't hit, since those were likely the most vulnerable parts. Wald's insight was based on understanding survivorship bias - that you need to study all possible cases, not just the cases that survive. Wald's advice to reinforce the armor over the engines saved lives and helped the Allies win the war.

Survivorship bias can skew our understanding of the world, as we may only see the evidence that has survived, like cave paintings. Abraham Wald's insights on survivorship bias are important to understanding who seeks, gets, and stays in power. To understand this, we need to explore three levels of survivorship bias: who seeks power, who gets power, and who stays in power. Identifying those who don't want power is also important.

There are three levels of survivorship bias in understanding who seeks, gets, and stays in power. Only those who try to gain power are the survivors in the first round. The survivors of the competition make it into power in the second round. Those who get power but lose it or leave it are invisible, and we tend to focus on people who seek, get, and hold on to power. Understanding this bias is crucial in solving problems related to corruptible people in positions of power.

The article discusses the concept of corruptible and incorruptible individuals and their pursuit of power. In an ideal world, only incorruptibles would hold positions of power, but many systems attract and promote corruptibles. Certain traits cause some people to want power more than others, and self-selection bias plays a role in who seeks power. The article explores what causes some people to want to lead, whether leaders are born or made, and whether a thirst for power is a genetic trait. The author met with Marie-France Bokassa in Paris to discuss these concepts.

The article tells the story of Marie-France Bokassa, daughter of Jean-Bédel Bokassa, a ruthless dictator who ruled the Central African Empire. Bokassa was coronated in 1977 in a ceremony that cost a quarter of the country's annual budget, with Bokassa himself dressed in an ermine cloak and a glittering crown with an eighty-carat diamond. The French troops deposed Bokassa in 1979 and replaced him with their chosen successor. When soldiers arrived at Bokassa's palace, they found a world of obscene luxury.

French soldiers cataloging the wealth stolen by former Central African Republic dictator, Bokassa, found evidence of his brutal reign including decaying bones of his victims, Nile crocodiles that had been fed his enemies, and two carved-up bodies in his refrigerator, allegedly kept fresh for special occasions. Bokassa had an unquenchable thirst for power and was rumored to have served human meat to visiting dignitaries. The article suggests that his desire to control, abuse, and kill others may have been written into his DNA. The author attempts to speak to one of Bokassa's children, who now live in France, to gain insight into the dictator's character.

The article explores the life of Marie-France Bokassa, one of the children of former Central African Republic dictator, Bokassa. Despite her father's brutal reign, Marie-France is proud of her Bokassa name and does not want to change it. The article delves into the age-old nature-versus-nurture debate and suggests that while Bokassa's traumatic upbringing may have contributed to his behavior, Marie-France believes that it taught him to be hard and strong. The author questions whether Marie-France lives in her father's genetic shadow and whether she is doomed to the same thirst for power that made him become a dictator.

Marie-France, the daughter of former Central African Republic leader Jean-Bédel Bokassa, suffers from a variant of Stockholm syndrome and views her father as a hero rather than a tyrant. Her father was mercurial and volatile, with constant mood swings and brutal punishments for those who displeased him. While Marie-France has come to accept her father's legacy, she rejects the notion that power corrupted him and believes he was always the same man. However, she acknowledges that power attracted him and wonders if she inherited his thirst for authority.

Marie-France, daughter of former Central African Republic leader Jean-Bédel Bokassa, inherited her father's positive traits such as generosity and intelligence, but also his negative traits including temper, authoritarian personality, and severe mood swings. She runs a tearoom outside Paris and believes a Bokassa should rule the country again, not ruling out the possibility of herself as a potential ruler. Genes shape behavior, but we are not bound by our parents' genes. A study by the University of Minnesota comparing identical and fraternal twins suggests that genes play a role in seeking power, but how much is left up to individuals.

A study found that 30% of the variation between individuals' leadership skills could be explained by genes. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 4,000 people to identify snippets of genetic code associated with taking charge and identified rs4950 as a "leadership gene." However, these findings are overstated and misleading, and it is not possible to create leaders by inserting extra genetic code.

The correlation between genetics and leadership skills is complex and influenced by various demographic and environmental factors. While genetics may play a role in determining dominance in other animal species, it's challenging to determine the extent of genetics' impact on human leadership skills. Factors such as environmental upbringing, supportive parents, and past experiences also influence an individual's behavior.

Research has shown that social dominance can be inherited in animals through genes and learned behavior. Selective breeding and genetic alterations have produced supersubmissive or superdominant rats and mice, while experiments with zebrafish suggest that social status can be passed down from fathers to sons. However, genes are not the only factor that determines who obtains power and not all humans aspire to leadership positions. Only 34% of US corporate survey respondents aspired to leadership positions and power is not universally coveted.

People have varying motivations for seeking power, including serving their community, craving recognition or prestige, and wanting to dominate or abuse others. Measures such as nPow and Social Dominance Orientation can assess an individual's desire for power and propensity to dominate others. Whether the variation in desire for power is more nature or nurture-driven is still an open question. Efforts to encourage gentler, kinder people to seek power through recruitment policies or changing perceptions are being considered. Police reform efforts following the murder of George Floyd are being criticized for not addressing the root of the issue.

The focus of fixing policing should be less on changing the behavior of current officers and more on recruiting new officers. Doraville, a small town in Georgia with a low crime rate, owns an armored vehicle and has used a recruitment video referencing the Punisher. The article argues that departments should focus on attracting new officers rather than solely trying to change the behavior of current ones.

Recruiting into positions of power involves considering who is likely to apply in the first place. The article discusses how a recruitment video for the Doraville Police Department attracts certain types of applicants and may deter others. The US government's 1033 Program has transferred over $7 billion in surplus military equipment to police departments, including small departments with little need for such equipment. The article questions the need for such equipment and how it affects police behavior.

The presence of military-grade equipment in police departments attracts certain types of individuals who may be abusive and drawn to power. Domestic abuse by police officers is a significant problem, and some argue that abusive people are drawn to powerful occupations where it is easier to abuse others. The recruitment process should aim to weed out these types of individuals. The image of the police department matters in attracting the right people. The military mindset of police officers can also lead to hiring more ex-soldiers, as government programs and incentives encourage this transition.

While hiring veterans can be beneficial, the skills required for being a soldier and a police officer are distinct, and conflating the two can be disastrous. Police departments that feel like an army and have more surplus military gear tend to kill more civilians. Police reform efforts should focus on who the police are rather than just changing their tactics. It may be more effective to attract less aggressive individuals to the profession in the first place rather than retraining aggressive officers.

New Zealand's police force has a playful recruitment campaign that emphasizes community involvement and caring for others. The videos spread widely on social media and contrast with the more serious approach taken by some other police forces. The campaign aims to attract recruits who can make a real difference and care about their communities. The videos feature diverse officers pursuing a fluffy border collie and helping an elderly man cross the street. In another video, the police department sends a malnourished child to rummage through garbage cans, and some people ignore him while others stop to help.

New Zealand's police force has a recruitment strategy that emphasizes community involvement and compassion, rather than a militarized approach. The recruitment videos highlight women and ethnic minorities, and applicants are assessed for their approach to dealing with the community before the vetting process begins. The strategy has resulted in the recruitment of 1800 new officers in recent years. The focus on community policing rather than a military approach has attracted a diverse group of applicants.

New Zealand has increased the number of female and Maori applicants to their police force by 29% and 32%, respectively, resulting in a more diverse and representative police force. This has led to a decrease in police abuse and deaths caused by police, with only 21 deaths in New Zealand between 1990 and 2015 compared to 1,146 in the United States in 2015 alone. The focus on increasing diversity in the recruitment process has resulted in a more effective and less abusive police force in New Zealand.

Without competition, undesirable candidates may fill positions of authority, such as in homeowners associations (HOAs) in the US, where $90 billion per year is collected in dues. HOA enforcers, often neighbors, impose fines on rule breakers, leading to the growth of rainy-day funds. However, the position of HOA enforcer may not be attractive, resulting in self-selection and the potential for undesirable individuals to wield power.

In a small Arizona community, an apathetic HOA board struggled to find volunteers until Martin McFife came along. However, after winning the election unopposed, McFife became difficult to work with and purposely made things difficult for others. He consolidated power by handpicking replacements for retiring incumbents and imposing strict rules with heavy fines. Residents who challenged him were punished with more fines, causing resentment and frustration within the community.

After Martin McFife took over the HOA in a small Arizona community, he imposed strict rules and heavy fines, even creating new regulations to target specific residents. When the Torres family complained, they received a document trashing them and targeting them by name. In protest, the Torreses and their neighbors put pink flamingos in their yard, which infuriated McFife. The newsletters targeting the Torreses contained shouty capital letters and warnings of neighborhood decline.

The article highlights the contentious and often abusive behavior of homeowners associations (HOAs), citing an example of a board member's obsession with enforcing rules leading to his downfall. The article notes that such abuses are common and suggests that power tends to attract those who want to control others, creating a self-selection bias. The author proposes that recognizing this tendency can help counteract it and promote more positive leadership.

The article suggests that businesses, political parties, and homeowners associations can take steps to attract and recruit effective leaders who do not seek power for its own sake. It emphasizes the importance of creating incentives and competition to attract a diverse range of leaders and prevent power-hungry individuals from monopolizing control. The article concludes with an anecdote about a journalist who was unexpectedly chosen as one of China's hottest bachelors.

A white freelance journalist in Beijing is offered a job in Dongying, China to pose as a businessman in a factory for a week, despite having no experience in quality control or business. Along with other white men, he arrives at the factory and is given fake safety gear and offices. The job they were hired to do remains unclear.

The white men hired for the factory job were fakes posing as employees of a nonexistent Californian parent company. They were part of a trend in China where foreigners are hired to lend credibility to an operation. Sometimes, white women are hired for bars and in one instance, a fake country music band was created with a Spanish woman lead singer who couldn't speak English.

Appearance often matters more than ability in human society, including in the allocation of power. This is evident in both Eastern and Western cultures, as demonstrated by the overrepresentation of white men in Fortune 500 CEO positions in the US. Similar disparities exist in the UK, where few top companies are led by women. These imbalances reflect a larger societal issue of giving authority to a narrow segment of the population based on superficial factors such as gender and race.

The lack of representation of women and ethnic minorities in top leadership positions in the tech sector and other industries is a reflection of societal sexism and racism. This can deter talented individuals from joining major corporations and contribute to a lack of diversity in senior management teams. The problem is compounded when these individuals leave for smaller start-ups with greater opportunities for advancement. Similar disparities exist in politics, with only 8% of UN member countries led by women. Though progress has been made, it has been slow.

The proportion of women in political power globally remains low, even in rich, developed democracies. Despite improvements, the United States is still below the world average. Rwanda has the highest proportion of women in parliament, but this is because the male dictator has cynically packed parliament with powerless women. Power is relational, and individuals need people to control to become powerful. The reason why cruel, incompetent people are often in positions of authority, and why many of them are white men, is partly due to the flawed evolution of our brains and the importance of signaling and status symbols.

Springboks launch themselves high into the air in a behavior known as stotting or pronking to show predators, such as lions or cheetahs, how agile they are and discourage them from attacking. This behavior is an example of signaling theory, where species evolve to convey information quickly to avoid wasting energy in a pointless chase. Without pronking, predators would have to chase and find out which prey are most agile, which is bad for both the predator and the prey.

The text discusses honest and dishonest signals in animals, such as the springbok's agility and speed being an honest signal, and the fiddler crab's oversize claw being a dishonest signal. The costly nature of signals is also discussed, with examples such as peacock's plumes being a costly honest signal. These dimensions can also be useful for analyzing human behavior in terms of power.

The text discusses signaling theory in relation to power and dominance, and explores a research study conducted by Professor Dana Carney on the effects of adopting a "power pose" to project confidence and strength. The study gained popularity but was later called into question when other researchers were unable to replicate its findings, leading to a controversy and the launch of the replication crisis in psychology.

Our presentation affects how others perceive us, and our brains are effective at creating a composite assessment of someone's status from seemingly insignificant cues. Signals of excess wealth are often used to show off one's new status, and it is most effective when it is frivolous. In indigenous societies, high-status individuals or families deliberately destroy wealth to show that they can.

Ostentatious displays of wealth can lead to attaining status and power in society. Such displays are rational because they represent the conversion of money into social capital. Humans instinctively use displays of wealth to signal status and this is an important shortcut for status displays as we do not walk around with our bank account balances or job titles taped to our foreheads. In an experiment, men were more likely to donate more money to charity in the presence of an attractive woman, as they believed it was a surefire way to signal status.

The effectiveness of status symbols as signals of wealth and power lies in their genuine costliness, which makes them difficult to obtain for the masses. When previously costly symbols become cheap and accessible, their potency diminishes, and new symbols arise. As a species, humans obsess over these arbitrary signals because they understand their importance in social status. However, these forms of signaling do little to address issues of underrepresentation in certain communities.

Despite advancements in modern leadership, the power gap persists. Our Stone Age brains are wired for survival in a world where sugar and fat were scarce, leading to a mismatch with the abundance of these substances today. Similarly, we remain instinctively afraid of snakes and spiders despite their decreased threat to humans. These examples of evolutionary mismatch highlight the difficulty in making decisions that align with modern realities.

The sudden changes in human society have created mismatches between our Stone Age instincts and our modern lifestyle, leading to health problems and fear of the wrong things. It is reasonable to wonder if we have a corresponding mismatch in selecting leaders, as evidence shows our Stone Age brains prioritize certain physical traits over others when choosing leaders. These preferences are always present, according to evolutionary psychology professor Mark van Vugt.

Although cognitive biases exist within many of us due to our Stone Age way of thinking, it is possible and essential to override them. Hunter-gatherer societies had informal leaders who were physically imposing and selected for cues of health and stamina, reinforcing the preference for physically strong leaders. However, this preference is outdated and no longer reflects modern realities. It is time to unlearn these instincts and choose leaders based on more relevant criteria.

A study by Professor Corinne Moss-Racusin of Skidmore College found that faculty members consistently rated male applicants for a laboratory manager job higher and assigned them a higher potential starting salary, even when the female and male applicants had the same qualifications and experience. The only difference was the names assigned to them. This bias against women raises the question of whether misogyny is rooted in our prehistoric past or culturally learned. Professor Mary Beard of the University of Cambridge has shown that women have been written out of history and the idea of granting power to women was often viewed as absurd.

Sexist tropes against women in positions of power have persisted for centuries, including the idea that women are incapable of speaking properly in public or are conniving and manipulative when in power. Research has shown that on average, women are less prone to despotism and more eager to rule by democratic means, and perform the same or better than men on leadership metrics. However, gender essentialism should be avoided, and it's important to elevate more women to leadership positions for a just and wise society.

There is no gender advantage in wielding power, but society often rewards masculine shows of strength in political leaders despite their irrelevance in modern times. The perception of leadership is still linked to physical size due to our Stone Age brains. The effectiveness of political leaders should not be tied to how much they can bench-press. Additionally, research findings using modern computer-imaging technology suggest that male faces are chosen more often than female faces in leadership experiments, but enhancing perceived masculinity does not always change feelings towards a face in a straightforward way.

Research suggests that in times of crisis, we subconsciously favor leaders who appear more manly, and this effect is magnified. This is known as the savanna hypothesis, which explains that our brains have templates for selecting leaders based on characteristics of good warriors or hunters from the Stone Age. Authoritarian-style strongmen often gin up fear or provoke conflicts to consolidate power by activating our hunter-gatherer instincts. This bias is not just in favor of male leaders but also toward large, physically imposing men. In securing power, it is good to be tall.

Throughout history, height has been associated with status, as seen in examples such as Alexander the Great sparing a tall aide and the creation of the Prussian army unit known as the Potsdam Giants. The Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I became obsessed with tall soldiers and went to great lengths to acquire them, including kidnapping and forced breeding. However, by the time he was ruling, height had become irrelevant in modern combat, and the Potsdam Giants were ultimately defeated by Napoleon's army.

The fixation on height as an indicator of status and success persists into modern times. Research shows that taller American presidents are more likely to win elections and be reelected, and taller people generally earn more money throughout their careers. This may be due to evolutionary mismatch, as height no longer confers a major advantage in modern society. However, height still plays a larger role in perceptions of leadership for men than for women, likely reflecting the significance of height for male hunters and warriors in ancient times.

Biases towards height and gender persist, with men and taller men receiving more power than women and shorter men. Racism is not reinforced by evolutionary psychology in the same way because encounters with people from different races were rare for our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Most Stone Age hunter-gatherers did not look like modern Europeans or Americans, so racism is culturally learned. Our Stone Age brains contribute to these biases.

Social species have evolved to quickly sort individuals into in-group and out-group categories based on physical cues to identify friends and potential foes, leading to biases. This sorting mechanism is still used by some people today as a cognitive shortcut, leading to irrational behavior. In an experiment, football fans helped someone wearing a Manchester United jersey 92% of the time compared to 35% for someone in a neutral shirt and just 30% for those wearing a rival team shirt. In another experiment, college students exhibited biases towards their own team and discriminated against the out-group.

Human biases, stemming from prehistoric templates for determining in-groups and out-groups, can cause us to choose inferior leaders and be suspicious of those who are different from us. These biases intersect with culturally learned racism, leading to biased assessments of minorities. Additionally, people often judge others based on their baby-faced appearance, perceiving them as less threatening and more innocent. However, studies have found that the impact of babyfaceness on gaining power is dependent on race, with black people being more likely to be disadvantaged.

White people are more likely to view black people with adult faces as threatening, leading to reduced career advancement. However, in a white-dominated society, baby-faced black people are more likely to attain power than less baby-faced black people. The inverse relationship exists for white people, with baby-faced white CEOs perceived as weak. Irrational evaluations of faces based on archaic threat instincts continue to entrench inequality and contribute to discrimination against minorities, such as through the use of race-based names on resumes. However, in-group and out-group affiliations need not be defined by race.

To ensure that leadership is diverse, organizations should produce data about the demographic composition of their leadership, use blind recruitment and promotion, have diverse hiring and recruitment panels, and anonymize school assignments and exams. These measures can make a meaningful impact in creating a fairer system, although they may not eliminate systemic inequalities.

The article explores why corrupt or corruptible people are effective at manipulating their way into power and why many leaders seem to be narcissistic psychopaths. It discusses the evolutionary psychology perspective and highlights the difficulty of testing its core claims. The article also includes a real-life story of a teacher who faced challenges in improving the heating conditions in his classroom.

Steve Raucci, a school maintenance official in the Schenectady school district, was tasked with reducing the district's energy bill. He went to extreme measures, such as cutting electrical cords of outlawed machines and removing space heaters, to achieve this goal. Raucci's behavior was driven by the desire for promotion and approval from his bosses.

Steve Raucci, a school maintenance official in the Schenectady school district, plotted to destroy his colleague, Lou Semione, who was made the district's energy-saving czar. Raucci secretly manipulated a new software system to increase energy usage and get Semione fired, ultimately succeeding in taking his job and increasing his paycheck to six figures. Raucci became known for his extreme cost-saving measures and intolerance for energy waste, even removing space heaters during the holidays.

Steven Raucci, a former school district employee in New York, engaged in progressively worse behavior including sexual harassment and threats to those who challenged him. He sought to conquer the school district's union but was exposed for his abuses in a letter. Raucci retaliated by vandalizing the home of two employees he suspected of betraying him, and forced his subordinates to admire the vandalism as a display of loyalty.

Steven Raucci used vandalism and explosives to intimidate those who crossed him, including slashing the tires of a man who complained about his behavior and damaging the truck of another who spoke out against him. Raucci saved the district millions and tried to build alliances to protect himself from whistleblowers. However, he made mistakes, including leaving DNA evidence at a crime scene. He was eventually arrested at a diner by the police.

Steven Raucci, a school maintenance official, was convicted of multiple crimes including planting explosives, and was sentenced to 23 years to life in prison. Evidence against him included DNA found on an unlit cigarette fuse and recordings of him boasting about his power and showing off homemade explosives. Abusive supervisors are common in workplaces and can range from overconfident blowhards to more sinister individuals.

The chapter explores the dark triad personality traits of psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism, and how they can be destructive in positions of authority. The traits exist on a continuum and can manifest in harmless doses in most people, but extreme levels of these traits can be problematic for those around them. The chapter also asks whether psychopaths make better leaders and explores the common traits of overconfidence and arrogance in powerful people.

A quick, rough measure of the "Dark Triad" traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) can be obtained through a 12-question test called the Dirty Dozen. However, to detect fakers, more robust measures are needed. Psychopaths with Dark Triad traits often fool others into thinking they're kind and compassionate. Myrmarachne melanotarsa, the dark-footed ant spider, is an example of mimicry in nature, which can be applied to identifying individuals with Dark Triad traits.

The dark-footed ant spider mimics ants in appearance and behavior to avoid being eaten by predators and to prey on spider eggs. Psychopaths also mimic normally functioning people to prey on them. Philippe Pinel developed the typology of "manie sans delire" for behavior lacking remorse or delirium, known as moral insanity.

Empathy operates through two systems - bottom-up and top-down. The former is associated with the mirror neuron system, and the latter comes from mentalizing. Empathy can be quantified through brain activity changes using fMRI machines. Psychopaths, when scanned while watching someone get hurt, showed a lack of activation in brain regions associated with emotion, indicating a deficit in empathy.

Psychopaths can feel empathy when coached to do so, but their regulation of top-down and bottom-up processing is different from normal people. Psychopaths' empathy is switched off by default, whereas normal brains have empathy switched on more often. Technology, such as magnetic stimulation, can partially switch empathy off in normal people.

Psychopaths can turn on empathy as needed, but their natural emotion is anger. The successful psychopaths are in positions of power, such as boardrooms and politics, where charm and charisma are valued. Not all psychopaths are violent, and some can blend in well in society. The unsuccessful ones are the ones who cannot control their impulses and end up in jail.

Job interviews reward those who can showcase charm, charisma, and confidence, which are traits of the dark triad, particularly psychopaths and Machiavellians. These individuals are skilled at impression management, lying, and adapting to the interviewer's expectations to secure the job. Psychopaths, in particular, can change themselves completely to match the interviewer's expectations. This makes the hiring process disproportionately favorable to the dark triad.

Psychopaths may fabricate their qualifications and personas to succeed in their careers, but those who cannot control their behavior may face negative consequences. However, the dark triad traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy can be advantageous when they work together. The most successful psychopaths in corporate hierarchies are likely those who can control themselves while seeking to control others. A study of over 200 corporate professionals selected for management development training programs found that most scored low on psychopathy.

Researchers use a checklist to measure psychopathy, with scores above 30 indicating definite psychopathy. In a study of 200 managers being groomed for top positions, 8 participants scored above 30, compared to about 1 in 500 in the general population. Two of these high-scoring individuals held vice-president positions, indicating that psychopaths may already be in top leadership positions. Dark triad traits can make corruptible people crave power and be effective at getting it, likely due to a laser-like focus on ruthless self-interest.

In a study, researchers conducted the ultimatum game with participants and evaluated them for psychopathic traits. The more psychopathic a person was, the more they were willing to accept unfair offers that benefited them, showing that they may prioritize self-interest over fairness. Skin conductance response was also measured to gauge emotional responses.

In a study, participants with psychopathic traits showed less emotional response to unfair offers in the ultimatum game, and different parts of their brains were activated compared to those without such traits. Psychopaths may view an unfair offer as a personal affront rather than a moral issue. Successful psychopaths can manage their anger while not being swayed by compassion, and may use these traits to advance in certain careers.

Psychopaths are drawn to positions of power and control, and are overrepresented in fields such as CEOs, lawyers, journalists, police officers, and politicians. They are more likely to exhibit destructive behavior and are better at achieving their goals, making them a danger to society. Psychopaths in positions of authority may harm others if it benefits their own ascent to power. Studies show that Washington, DC has the most psychopaths per capita of any region in the US. The concentration of psychopaths in influential areas highlights the potential danger of a small number of destructive individuals.

Psychopaths are more likely to make utilitarian choices, prioritizing self-interest over morality. While some people see this as an advantage in leadership, studies show that psychopathic leaders are less effective than those with fewer psychopathic traits. Psychopaths may be charming and charismatic, but they underperform in wielding power effectively. The dark triad may help abusive people rise to the top but makes them ineffective leaders.

A study of 101 hedge fund managers found that as psychopathy increased, performance decreased due to elevated levels of impulsivity and reckless risk-taking. Psychopaths tend to think they can outsmart consequences, leading to big losses. This characteristic also explains why dictators, who share common risk, tend to leave office in exile, jail, or caskets. Nearly half of African despots who lose power end up in similar fates, while in Haiti, the odds are even worse.

People with dark triad traits are drawn to being a dictator because they believe they are special and the risks of predecessors don't apply to them. This is due to their psychopathic tendency to think they can outsmart consequences. The same traits may also help individuals in some professions, such as being a surgeon or a Special Forces soldier, where being cold and unaffected by stress or emotion is useful. Low to moderate levels of psychopathy can help individuals perform well under stress and avoid making irrational decisions.

Elite troops and bomb-disposal technicians show physiological abnormalities that allow them to carry out intense tasks without getting overwhelmed. However, it is difficult to distinguish functional psychopaths from dysfunctional ones, and psychological evaluations are not foolproof. Overconfident people are all around us, and it is unclear why they often hold positions of authority. Meerkats may provide insight into decision-making processes through vocalization.

In meerkats, the certainty of an individual making a move call is more important than social rank in influencing the behavior of the group. African wild dogs use sneezing instead of move calls, and the status of the sneezer matters. Humans are a mix of the two, where confidence is also a factor. Overconfidence may have helped humans survive in the past by making it more likely to get scarce resources such as food. This is a gamble, but it was rational in an era when the alternative was starvation.

Overconfidence was adaptive in the past as it helped groups survive by following confident leaders, but it is now maladaptive. However, studies have shown that overconfident individuals tend to obtain social status even if they are incompetent. The use of sweeping language in grant applications also increases the chances of obtaining funding, even if the research quality is the same as more technical proposals. There is a gender skew in this phenomenon as well.

Overconfidence can help individuals obtain power and authority, even if they are incompetent. Some power-hungry individuals are overconfident psychopaths or manipulative narcissists who rise in the ranks through intimidation. However, systems and cultures also play a role in shaping behavior and preventing destructive impulses. To understand this interplay, we need to explore diverse examples, such as the rise of bicycles facilitating atrocities and the structure of beehives. Some US states have lower rates of destructive behavior, but it is unclear if this is due to statistical noise.

Researchers conducted two studies in six Chinese cities observing patrons at various Starbucks locations. In one study, they measured how many people sat alone or with others, and in the other, they conducted a chair test to see how many people moved a chair that was placed in the way. They found that in two cities, more people sat alone and were more likely to move the chair out of the way. This behavior was also observed in Japan and the US, with twice as many Americans moving the chair.

Researchers observed patrons at various Starbucks locations in six Chinese cities and found that those who sat alone and moved chairs were in the north, while those who sat with friends and accepted the chair's position were in the south. This behavior can be explained by rice theory, which suggests that areas that have relied on rice for thousands of years become more communal, while regions full of wheat are more individualistic. This theory explains how our behavior is subconsciously affected by the culture we grow up in or live in, leading to differences in how we approach individualism and communalism.

Starbucks researchers found that people from rice-dominated areas, such as Japan, tend to behave more communally, while people from wheat-focused areas, such as the US, tend to behave more individually. Cultural influences can also affect how people think, with Japanese people tending to be holistic thinkers and Americans tending to be analytical thinkers. The rice-wheat divide also shows up in China, with people from wheat regions more likely to categorize items analytically. Cultural influences can have an effect on behavior and thinking, but they do not entirely determine our destiny.

The rice theory suggests that cultural influences can affect behavior and thinking, and that systems matter in shaping behavior. It can be difficult to distinguish between bad people and bad systems when those in authority abuse their power, as humans are prone to fundamental attribution error. Improving the world requires understanding this distinction and working to address systemic issues.

People tend to make fundamental attribution errors by assuming that others' bad behavior is due to their poor character, while excusing their own bad behavior as a result of external factors. This was shown in a study in Austria where motorists interpreted careless driving as malicious when done by someone else but rationalized their own careless driving. However, the problem is that if put in a worse situation or system, people may be tempted to behave badly as well. Diplomatic immunity is an example of how some people are above the law.

Diplomats in New York City used to be able to park illegally without consequence due to diplomatic immunity. In 2002, the city implemented a three-strikes rule and stripped thirty countries of their special license plates for unpaid parking tickets. This created a natural experiment in which a control group (diplomats in the pre-enforcement period) and a treatment group (diplomats in the post-enforcement period) could be compared to see if behavior shifted. The only significant difference was the enforcement of the rule.

Two economists studied parking violations by diplomats in New York City and found that culture and context play a big role in whether people break the law. Diplomats from countries known for corruption, such as Kuwait and Egypt, had high numbers of parking violations, while those from Sweden, Norway, and Japan had none. When enforcement was increased, diplomats from corrupt countries quickly changed their behavior and had significantly fewer violations.

Culture and context play a significant role in individual behavior, as seen in studies of parking violations by diplomats in New York City and employee behavior in different regions of Italy. Diplomats from corrupt countries had higher numbers of parking violations, and diplomats from clean countries tended to park illegally more often the longer they were in New York. The local systems that individuals work in also greatly influence their behavior. Additionally, individuals behave differently depending on how they believe a system operates.

The article discusses the misconception that corruption is exclusive to certain countries and explores the influence of systems and individuals on corrupt behavior. American tourists in Chile sometimes attempt to bribe police officers, unaware that it is a crime, suggesting that bad behavior can arise from a false belief in how a system operates. The article argues that understanding whether power makes people worse is important, and that targeting reforms should depend on whether the system or individuals are to blame for corruption. The behavior of bees and wasps, which have varying levels of corruption and dedicated workers who act as insect cops, is used to demonstrate that the rules and structures around them have a significant impact on their behavior.

The article discusses how worker bees and wasps have an instinct to pass on their genes, but excess queens can be detrimental to the productivity of the hive. To solve this problem, worker bees and wasps have evolved a policing mechanism to prevent rogue social climbers from joining the royal family. Excess queens are beheaded or torn apart by the workers soon after they emerge from their cells. However, sometimes the wasps doing the policing abuse their authority for their own benefit.

The behavior of some wasps and bees can be opportunistic and selfish, leading to the killing of eggs and laying of their own eggs. The level of this behavior varies among different species and is determined by the effectiveness of policing within the hive. When policing is ineffective, individuals are more likely to act selfishly, but when it is effective, there are fewer instances of such behavior. The difference in behavior is not due to the individual but rather the hive system in place.

Systems guide behavior in humans, similar to bees. The impact of a system on an individual's behavior is not clear, but a natural experiment involving ruling over two systems can provide insights. King Leopold II of Belgium ruled over a good system in Belgium, where he was a benevolent reformer, and a bad system in the Congo, where he committed atrocities for personal gain. This experiment suggests that power corrupts most in bad systems.

King Leopold II of Belgium became fascinated with the idea of colonization after reading a practical guidebook on managing a colony. He wanted Belgium to have a slice of Africa's resources and took control of the Congo Free State, which effectively became his personal fiefdom. However, he was ill-equipped to manage a colony and was facing financial ruin until the discovery of vulcanized rubber, which helped him generate enormous profits from the Congo's rubber resources.

The invention of vulcanized rubber didn't create demand until the bicycle boom of the late 1880s. King Leopold II of Belgium, realizing the global demand for rubber, saw the opportunity to exploit the rubber vines in his Congo colony. Workers were forced to collect rubber, leading to atrocities documented in the book King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild. Leopold's armed group, the Force Publique, punished those who resisted extracting rubber.



 During King Leopold II's reign, soldiers from the Force Publique in the Congo would take women as hostages and rape them while men went into the jungle to gather rubber for the Belgians. If the men didn't comply, the women would be murdered, and if the village continued to resist, everyone would be massacred. The soldiers were required to bring back proof of their killings, often in the form of right hands. Leopold imported Congolese people for display at a world fair in Brussels, forcing them to live in fake villages and putting them on display for the amusement of attendees. Between 2 and 12 million Congolese people were killed during Leopold's reign.



 King Leopold II of Belgium committed atrocities against the Congolese people, killing between 2 and 12 million. He personally profited from his actions, pocketing the equivalent of $1.1 billion today. In Belgium, Leopold faced accountability, but in the Congo Free State, he was a tyranny of one. On the other hand, there are cases where decent people are thrust into positions of power in awful systems, like the Viceroy of Vermont.

L. Paul Bremer III, an eighty-year-old man who inherited a dictatorship, has had a diverse career as a diplomat and served in posts in Afghanistan, Malawi, Norway, and Washington. He was appointed chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism and warned of the growing threat of massive casualties from terrorist attacks in 2000. Bremer was in the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, during the first plane hit. He now works at a ski resort, and his face looks younger than his age, which he credits to a lifetime of triathlons and marathons.

L. Paul Bremer III received a phone call from Donald Rumsfeld in 2003, offering him a job related to the recent invasion of Iraq, and he became the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority tasked with creating a smooth transition from dictatorship to democracy in Iraq. Bremer's first day in Baghdad was marked by an unnerving meeting, and he raised the possibility of the US military shooting looters to restore order. The idea was leaked to the press, and while many Americans were outraged, many Iraqis were not. Bremer believed in establishing democracy and rule of law in Iraq.

Paul Bremer, former US diplomat, defends his infamous looting order during the Iraq War, claiming that public safety is the primary role of any government and that shooting the looters would have saved lives. He inherited a brutal system in Iraq where people expected order to be produced at the barrel of a gun, and public opinion back home in a democracy where order was supposed to come from the rule of law. However, his suggestion to shoot the looters led to sectarian violence and civil war in Iraq. Bremer now lives alone with his dog and reflects on his legacy, decorated with accolades from a lifetime of public service.

Paul Bremer, former US diplomat, supported the Iraq War and sincerely believed in democracy and freedom, but faced criticism for his actions as the viceroy of Iraq, including the closure of a newspaper that incited violence against Americans. His values were tested in Iraq, where he inherited a brutal system and had to balance public safety with democratic principles. Despite being criticized as incompetent and dangerously naive, he took on one of the world's worst jobs in one of the world's most dangerous places out of a genuine desire to make other people's lives better.

Inheriting a bad system, Paul Bremer had to make life and death decisions as the administrator in Iraq. He realized his responsibility to restore electricity to hospitals and reviewed electrical supply diagrams daily. Bremer wanted to do the right thing but was constrained by the broken system and aggressive oversight. Due to a lack of planning before the invasion, he had to improvise.

Paul Bremer had to make choices constrained by Iraq's broken system, leading to some disastrous consequences. However, he wanted to do the right thing and his behavior was shaped by the system. Bad systems encourage abuse, while good systems prevent it. The solution is to reform systems to attract fewer corruptible individuals and stop those who become powerful from committing abuses. Before figuring out how to fix things, it's important to answer the question of whether power actually corrupts or if something else is going on. The chapter also references Lord Acton and the Inquisition, highlighting a man's torture and his cries for release.

The article describes torture methods used during the Spanish Inquisition and how a British bishop named Mandell Creighton documented it dispassionately in his historical works. He believed that it wasn't the historian's place to moralize and viewed the role of religious historians as being akin to that of professional apologists. However, Lord Acton criticized Creighton for his indifference to the torture and execution of innocents and his preference for literature over proving a case or burrowing towards a conclusion.

Lord Acton criticized Bishop Creighton's moral indifference towards the torture and execution of innocents during the Spanish Inquisition. Acton wrote that historic responsibility should hold powerful men accountable for their abuses, as power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This quote became famous, but our view of how much power corrupts is often overly cynical and mistaken. Four phenomena, dirty hands, learning to be good at being bad, opportunity knocks, and under the microscope, give us a skewed perspective when praising or condemning authority figures.

The belief that power corrupts people is often overblown due to cognitive mistakes we make when assessing those in charge. An encounter with former Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva reveals how assumptions about power and status can cloud our judgement. Despite accusations of mass murder, Vejjajiva speaks with a posh English accent and wears a T-shirt to donate blood.

The article explores the thin line between selflessness and corruption in politics through an interview with former Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. Abhisit was inspired to become a politician by student protests calling for democracy, but later faced accusations of mass murder during protests in 2010. He was picked by generals and a king to become an unelected prime minister and aimed to prove that he could stay honest and true to his principles while in office.

In 2010, around 120,000 opposition supporters protested against the Thai government and demanded Abhisit's resignation. The protests turned violent, with gunfire and grenades exchanged between soldiers and heavily armed protesters. The situation escalated to the point where a civil war was a realistic possibility. Abhisit ordered helicopters to drop leaflets warning protesters that the government had established live-fire zones, and those who entered could be shot. Despite this, militias conducted arson attacks, and some protesters were killed by snipers. The Thai military broke through the barricades on May 19, and the protest leaders surrendered.

In 2010, a brutal crackdown on opposition protests in Thailand led to 87 deaths and over 2,000 injuries. Abhisit, the Prime Minister at the time, faced mass murder charges after leaving office, but they were dropped when the military took control in a coup d'état in 2014. Abhisit and other Thai generals justified the crackdown as necessary to prevent a bloody civil war. The decision-making process of politicians in volatile countries often involves morally repugnant choices.

The article discusses the difficult moral calculations made by leaders in positions of power, which can result in the loss of many lives. The author reflects on their meetings with a former Thai prime minister, Abhisit, and the decisions he made during protests that resulted in the deaths of 87 people. The article highlights the concept of counterfactuals and how it is impossible to know how many lives could have been saved if different choices were made. The author acknowledges that such decisions are made all over the world by leaders facing impossible dilemmas. The article concludes with a quote from a play by Jean-Paul Sartre, emphasizing the difficulty of governing innocently.

The article discusses the "dirty hands problem" faced by politicians and other people in positions of authority who are forced to make difficult moral decisions that could result in harm to others. The author reflects on their meetings with a former Thai prime minister, Abhisit, and the decisions he made during protests that resulted in the deaths of 87 people. The article highlights the fact that sometimes leaders must weigh up two awful options and try to take the lesser evil. The author acknowledges that political leaders must be held accountable for any human rights abuses they authorize or enable but also notes that some people were going to die no matter what Abhisit did. The article concludes by acknowledging that the dirty-hands problem isn't just for politicians, but for all of us who delegate authority to others to make difficult decisions on our behalf.

The article discusses how even principled politicians may be expected to commit unprincipled acts when in control of large numbers of people. It cites Winston Churchill's decision to withhold information about an imminent attack on Australian ships, based on intelligence obtained through cracking Nazi codes, as an example of such an act. Churchill chose not to warn the Australians in order to maintain the secrecy of the code-breaking operation, knowing that doing so would put their ships at risk.

The "dirty-hands problem" can skew our evaluations of leaders by making them appear worse than they actually are. Churchill and Lincoln both got their hands dirty to achieve a greater good, but these episodes have been whitewashed from their well-known histories. Sometimes, people in authority seem worse not because they got corrupted, but because they learned new tricks. Immoral acts are, at times, the most moral choice for those in power.

Eric Allison, who grew up in a poor area in the north of England, noticed that only one family on his block owned a car. At the age of eleven, he broke into their house and found a jar of coins worth 20 quid. To avoid getting caught, he swept the floor and broke a small window to make it seem like a random break-in. However, one of his accomplices spent some of the stolen money, leading to their eventual capture. Allison learned the importance of picking accomplices wisely.

Eric Allison got caught by unreliable accomplices when he was young, but eventually became a full-time criminal. He experimented with heists and learned from his mistakes, targeting wealthy families for big scores that netted him six figures per year. He enjoyed stealing and didn't care about the money.

Eric Allison, a skilled thief, committed check fraud and burglarized a bank employee's home to gain access to bank records, targeting well-padded accounts with owners who didn't verify their statements often. He figured out a way to cash the stolen checks using banks in Gibraltar and Geneva, through an intermediary. Allison was proud of his heists and enjoyed the thrill of stealing, constantly seeking to improve his techniques. He successfully pulled off numerous heists over the years.

The article discusses the concept of "authoritarian learning" where individuals in positions of power learn to be more effective in their corrupt actions over time. Eric Allison, a skilled thief who spent seven years in prison, illustrates this concept. He misses the thrill of his old life and admits he would still be stealing if not for his job as a prison correspondent for the Guardian newspaper. Dictators also engage in authoritarian learning, sharing ideas and strategies at summits and innovating new methods of oppression.

Dictators improve their tactics for stealing elections through trial and error. Election rigging has evolved from crude methods like ballot-box stuffing to more sophisticated tactics such as replacing pens with disappearing ink and denying birth certificates to babies born in opposition areas. Corrupt governments get better at becoming corrupt, not because of a decline in moral character, but due to the improvement of their tactics. The adage of Lord Acton's megalomania is often cited to explain this phenomenon.

Dictators create bizarre myths about themselves as a strategic and rational means of staying in power. These myths are part of a cult of personality and serve as a loyalty test to distinguish people who can be trusted from those who cannot. In North Korea, the Kim dynasty has invented a theology called juche and has propagated myths such as their ability to compose operas and not needing to use the bathroom. Dictators constantly create new myths to test the loyalty of those within their regime and society.

The article explores how dictators learn to be good at being bad through a strategy of escalating lies and control, rather than being corrupted by power. It then presents an imaginary world where morality is based on statistical probability, highlighting the arbitrary nature of judging morality based on frequency of immoral behavior. The article concludes that goodness or badness should not be determined by frequency of behavior, but rather by a more comprehensive understanding of a person's actions and intentions.

The article challenges the common practice of assigning blame based on the frequency of immoral behavior, arguing that it is an arbitrary way of making moral judgments. The article uses the example of a psychopathic serial killer stranded on a desert island to illustrate this point. The article suggests that people in positions of authority face more frequent and consequential opportunities for wrongdoing, citing the example of doctors making life-or-death decisions during disasters. The article highlights the importance of a more comprehensive understanding of a person's actions and intentions when making moral judgments.

During Hurricane Katrina, floodwaters entered a hospital, causing it to become an isolated island with no power and limited resources. Patients and employees were trapped inside, and when the backup generator failed, patients on life support died. Dr. Anna Pou and colleagues triaged remaining patients into three categories, with the sickest being evacuated last, including those with do-not-resuscitate orders. Dr. Pou played a key role in this process.

During Hurricane Katrina, as the situation became more desperate in a hospital, doctors and nurses considered euthanizing patients who were unlikely to survive. One doctor left and instructed Dr. Anna Pou on how to administer lethal doses of sedatives to some patients. The decision to administer lethal doses was made for some patients, including those who were obese and unlikely to be rescued due to the lack of electricity. The hospital was running out of supplies, and some patients were in a horrific state due to the heat.

Dr. Anna Pou administered lethal doses of morphine and midazolam to patients at Memorial hospital during Hurricane Katrina, resulting in the deaths of nine patients. She was charged with murder, but the charges were eventually dropped, and three civil lawsuits were settled. Experts agree that her decisions caused the premature deaths of several patients, but opinions are divided on whether she should be considered a murderer or acted appropriately given the crisis.

People in positions of authority have more opportunities to do harm and when they make the wrong call, more people suffer. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that power made them worse people, but rather magnifies the consequences of their actions. The level of scrutiny they face is essential to evaluate people who behave badly. A hypothetical example of two embezzlers shows that the level of scrutiny can make one appear worse than the other, even though they are behaving identically.

The rich and powerful can often escape scrutiny for their actions, but sometimes their seemingly worse behavior can be attributed to increased scrutiny. Bernie Madoff was able to commit fraud for decades because nobody complained and he had established close friendships with those who could have exposed him. He may have been subject to less scrutiny due to personal links to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Bernie Madoff's ability to commit fraud for decades went undetected due to his manipulation of authorities and close relationships with those who could have exposed him. Millions of cases of small-scale fraud likely go undetected because the perpetrators do not control enough money to warrant investigation. A tweak to US tax forms in 1987 revealed up to 1 in 10 people claimed as dependents for tax breaks did not exist.

The article discusses how power can corrupt people and the mitigating factors that can exacerbate this. It uses an example of tax fraud to illustrate how corrupt behavior can often go unnoticed. The article suggests that corruptible people are drawn to power and that bad systems can make things worse. However, it also acknowledges that there are mitigating factors, such as dirty hands, learning, opportunity, and scrutiny, that can play a role in how power affects people. The article concludes that power does indeed corrupt, as Lord Acton famously claimed. The example of a bioterrorist who was also a caregiver for disabled people illustrates this point.

The article tells the story of Sheela Ambalal Patel, who grew up in India and later became a follower of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, a spiritual guru who promised enlightenment to his disciples. Sheela, who became known as Ma Anand Sheela, joined an ashram in India and later moved with Bhagwan to Oregon, where they established a commune called Rajneeshpuram. The commune was known for its blend of free love and capitalism and engaged in experimental therapies, including group sex sessions that were later alleged to involve violence and sexual abuse. Sheela became Bhagwan's spokesperson and was later convicted of attempted murder and other crimes related to the commune's activities.

Sheela, a young widow, became Bhagwan's right-hand woman and was tasked with finding a place to build a new age utopia. She bought the Big Muddy Ranch in central Oregon and renamed it Rancho Rajneesh. The locals were immediately suspicious of their new neighbors, and tensions rose as the Rajneeshees planned to build a massive commune. Sheela realized they had more American Rajneeshees than Antelope residents and decided to take over.

The sannyasins won the local elections in Antelope and changed the name to Rajneeshpuram, tripled taxes on the locals, and rebranded the cafe as Rajneesh Zorba the Buddha Restaurant. Sheela gained a taste for power and oversaw the construction of an airport, a shopping mall, a Medical Corporation, and a farm that supplied 90% of their food. She built a media empire and became a lightning rod of controversy. People learned not to cross her, and she hinted ominously about those who stood in the way of implementing Bhagwan's utopian dream.

Sheela, a cult leader in Rajneeshpuram, consolidated power and developed a heavily armed peace force, raising concerns of a potential Jonestown-style incident. The locals tried to take back control and hold Sheela accountable for violating regulations, but she refused to be taken down. She poisoned three county officials with potent bacteria after they inspected the ranch, causing two to be hospitalized.

Sheela poisoned county officials with bacteria after they inspected the ranch, and later poisoned nearly a thousand people in local restaurants to reduce election turnout. Investigators found evidence of Sheela's involvement and uncovered plots to use deadlier bacteria like Salmonella typhi and weaponize HIV.



 Sheela was involved in a plot to assassinate a US attorney and had a list of people to be killed, and had handpicked sannyasins as an assassination team. 

 She was also planning to kill Bhagwan's personal doctor and had books on how to commit the perfect crime. 

 She fled the ranch in 1985 and was later arrested, serving four years in prison before being deported. 

 Bhagwan denounced Sheela and fled the United States, later dying in 1990. 

 Rancho Rajneesh is now a Christian summer camp, with no trace of its origins on the website. 

 Sheela is now living in a care home in Switzerland and denies that power corrupted her.



 Sheela's extreme experience of tasting power is not a common one, as most people who experience power do not become bioterrorists or contemplate assassinations. 

 Dacher Keltner is a scholar who studies the cognitive effects of power, and his research suggests that power can corrupt individuals. 

 Keltner is a well-known researcher who studies emotions, feelings, power, awe, and the science behind human behavior. 

 Power studies became more systematic after World War II and have helped researchers understand the effects of power on individuals.

The article discusses the history of studying the effects of power on people, including the Milgram experiments and the Stanford Prison Experiment. Ethical limitations hindered research for a while, but in 2003, Keltner, Gruenfeld, and Anderson developed the Power Approach and Inhibition Theory, which suggests that power leads to approach behaviors while powerlessness leads to inhibition. The powerful are more likely to take action, pursue goals, take risks, seek rewards, and self-promote, while the powerless are reactive, cautious, and more attuned to threats. Keltner's approach is informed by experiments and observational data.

The article discusses how Keltner's theories are often informed by his lived experiences and observations, such as noticing that drivers of expensive cars are more likely to drive aggressively. He tested this hypothesis with an experiment and found that drivers of wealthy cars were more likely to drive through pedestrian zones. When a driver of a pricey Toyota Prius challenged the hypothesis, Keltner tested it and found that Prius drivers were actually the worst. Keltner's work highlights how power tends to make people lose their inhibitions.

In "The Power Paradox," Dacher Keltner argues that traits like kindness and competence help people rise to positions of power, but once they get there, those same traits are eroded by the corrosive effects of power. People with power become less effective at reading people, feel less need to empathize with others, and are more likely to abuse their authority. The applicability of the power paradox to different contexts, such as highly regulated corporations versus small businesses or drug kingpins, is uncertain.

Psychology research is plagued by the replication crisis and the WEIRD problem. The replication crisis refers to research findings that aren't replicated when another team of scientists conducts the same study. The WEIRD issue refers to the fact that many psychology studies use convenience sampling, which selects participants who are not representative of the general population but rather available and typically Western, Educated, Industrialized Rich Democracies (WEIRD). This limits the applicability of many findings, and biases them towards those contexts.

Psychology research predominantly uses undergraduate students from Western countries as research participants, creating a WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) bias that limits the generalizability of findings to other cultures. This bias needs to be addressed as power studies in academic literature may not apply to other groups. Despite this limitation, researchers have identified four main ways in which power changes our behavior.

Researchers use manipulations and priming approaches to study how power changes behavior, but some methods are less reliable than others. The most common experimental design finds that power makes people worse, as shown in the dictator game where the person with power tends to behave more selfishly.

A study on the effects of power on behavior found that as power increased, so did selfish behavior. In a dictator game, participants with more power were more likely to take more money for themselves, and this trend was amplified for those with higher levels of testosterone. Additionally, participants who said that leaders should share resources fairly did not always behave that way when in a leadership position.

A study found that power increases risk-taking behavior, as people in positions of power have a history of winning and can afford to take more risks. Feeling powerful also gives a false sense of control over risky situations, known as illusory control. In a study, participants who wrote about a time they felt powerful were more likely to choose to roll a dice themselves, even though it made no difference to the outcome. This behavior can be damaging in the real world when powerful people take unnecessary risks.

Research has found that those who believe they can manage risks are more likely to gamble with other people's lives. Powerful individuals tend to be less affected by others' traumatic experiences, empathizing less with those below them. This asymmetrical power dynamic causes subordinates to be more attuned to those who have control over them than vice versa. Studies show that gaining power tends to make people behave worse, interrupting others more, stereotyping more, using less moral reasoning, and being more judgmental. Overall, the scientific evidence suggests that power does not make people more virtuous.

Research on whether power corrupts has limitations, as it is difficult to confer real, lasting power in a lab and unethical to manipulate power dynamics in the real world. Observations in the real world can also be biased by self-selection effects. Experiments in a controlled setting are better than nothing but still not the same as real power. Nonetheless, available evidence suggests that becoming powerful makes people more selfish, reduces empathy, increases hypocrisy, and makes them more likely to commit abuse.

The text argues that conventional wisdom only focuses on the powerful people we can see and ignores the larger dangers lurking beneath the surface. It discusses how power changes people, not just in terms of decision-making and personality traits, but also physically. The article also explores the process of what happens to drugs seized in major busts and how some end up being refined and used for scientific research.

The article discusses how drugs seized in major busts end up being refined and used for scientific research, specifically with monkeys. Dr. Michael Nader and his team of researchers conducted an experiment to test how hierarchy, rank, and status affect the experience of using drugs. They established a social hierarchy among twenty-four macaques and scanned their brains to measure the number of dopamine receptors, which are associated with addiction. The study found that monkeys with low social status had fewer dopamine receptors and were more likely to become addicted to cocaine.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with reward pathways in the brain, and it interacts with two kinds of receptors: D1 and D2. D1 receptors give pleasure and reinforce addictive behaviors, while D2 receptors have a blunted effect. Researchers found that creating hierarchies among macaques can change the proportion and number of dopamine receptors. Dominant monkeys were found to be less likely to get addicted to cocaine. In an experiment, macaques were trained to associate levers with rewards such as food or cocaine.

At low to moderate doses of cocaine, subordinate macaques were more likely to choose cocaine over food, while dominant monkeys chose food. When the researchers switched the monkeys to a different group, the subordinate monkeys became even more susceptible to self-medicating with cocaine. However, the dominant monkeys remained resilient and chose food over cocaine. After the experiments, the dominant monkeys had an increased number of D2 receptors, showing that the chemical composition of their brains had been altered by power. The goal of the research is to better understand addiction in humans and find ways to break its magnetism.
