The text includes copyright information and references to Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers: The Story of Success" as well as a reading group guide, acknowledgments, and the author's conversation and discussion topics. The text also includes the ISBN number and publisher information for the book.

The book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell explores the factors that contribute to success, including the Matthew Effect, the 10,000-Hour Rule, the limitations of IQ, and cultural influences such as ethnicity and upbringing. Gladwell examines the lives of remarkable individuals, from software billionaires to professional athletes, and shows how their success is shaped by a combination of talent, hard work, and external circumstances. Ultimately, the book argues that success is not solely determined by individual merit, but is also influenced by social and cultural factors beyond our control.

Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is a highly acclaimed book that explores the factors that contribute to success. The book presents inventive theories about success and challenges the idea that individual merit alone determines success. Gladwell intelligently captures the power of cultural patterns and social contagions, offering a useful corrective to the Homo economicus view of human nature. The book is a must-read for educators, recruiters, and parents and has been described as a compelling, entertaining, and thought-provoking read that exposes the rarely acknowledged forces behind success.

The book "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell is praised for its ability to turn academic research into engaging stories about real people. It offers insights into how certain individuals become successful and challenges conventional wisdom. Gladwell's accessible writing style and use of scientific research make his ideas thought-provoking and entertaining. The book is seen as a valuable tool for challenging counterproductive attitudes towards education and life.

"Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell is a thought-provoking and insightful book that challenges readers to think about intelligence, success, and fame in a new way. Gladwell uses anecdotes and data to show how circumstances and environment can limit great minds and emphasizes the need to cultivate them. The book is entertaining, informative, and narrated expertly, making it a success among general readers. Gladwell's unique perspective broadens readers' perspectives and stimulates their minds.

Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers" uses anecdotes and interviews to postulate that timing, circumstance, and luck are just as important as grit and brains for success. He explores the patterns behind everyday phenomena and tears down the myth of individual merit. The book is enjoyable, clear, and stimulating, with Gladwell's timing being impeccable. The target audience includes business students, executives, and anxious parents.

Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers" begins with the story of Roseto, a town in Italy whose residents had low rates of heart disease despite unhealthy lifestyles. Gladwell uses this story to introduce the concept of outliers, which are statistical observations that are markedly different from others in a sample. The town of Roseto's success was attributed to their strong community bonds and social support, despite their poverty and lack of education.



 In the late 19th century, a group of Italian immigrants from the village of Roseto migrated to Bangor, Pennsylvania to work in slate quarries. They sent word back to Roseto about opportunities in the New World, which resulted in a flood of immigrants to the town. The Rosetans built closely-clustered stone houses, a church, and established businesses. A young priest named Father Pasquale de Nisco encouraged the townsfolk to farm, leading to the growth of the town. The neighboring town of Bangor was largely Welsh.



 Roseto, Pennsylvania was a self-sufficient town comprised mainly of Italian immigrants who spoke the southern Foggian dialect. It was largely unknown to the society around it until physician Stewart Wolf visited in the late 1950s and discovered that heart disease was rare in the town. This was unusual given that heart disease was an epidemic in the United States at the time. Wolf decided to investigate further.

In the 1960s, researchers gathered death certificates, medical histories, and genealogies from residents of Roseto, a town in Pennsylvania, and conducted medical tests. They found that the death rate from heart disease and all causes was lower than expected, and there was very little crime, drug addiction, or alcoholism. The researchers were surprised by the results, and attributed the community's health and well-being to its tight-knit social structure and strong family ties.

Roseto, a town in Pennsylvania, was an outlier in terms of health and well-being, despite its residents' unhealthy eating habits, smoking, and obesity. Researchers ruled out diet, exercise, and genetics as factors and instead looked at the town's social structure and found that its tight-knit community and strong family ties were likely responsible for its residents' good health.

The key to the good health of Rosetans was not diet, exercise, genes or location, but the social structure of their tight-knit community. The extended family clans, respect for elders, civic organizations, and egalitarian ethos protected them from the pressures of the modern world. Transplanting the paesani culture of southern Italy to eastern Pennsylvania created a world of family meals, bakeries, people walking and talking on the street, and a community that helped each other.

Initially met with skepticism, the findings of Wolf and Bruhn showed that the community and social structure of Roseto played a significant role in the health and longevity of its residents. They had to convince the medical establishment to look beyond an individual's personal choices and actions and understand the culture, values, and people they surround themselves with. This understanding of community is what Malcolm Gladwell wants to bring to our understanding of success in his book "Outliers". The first chapter explores the Matthew Effect, which states that those who have more opportunities will continue to have even more success.

In the 2007 Memorial Cup hockey championships, the Medicine Hat Tigers and Vancouver Giants, the top teams in the Canadian Hockey League, played a spirited game. Vancouver won 3-1, with the deciding goal in the third period, and celebrated in the locker room with champagne and a hand-painted banner that read "Embrace the Struggle". Gordie Howe, a hockey legend, was also present at the game.

The Canadian hockey system is a meritocracy where boys are evaluated and separated based on their talent at each level of play, culminating in Major Junior A, the top league. Success is based on individual merit, not background or arbitrary factors. The book is about outliers in hockey.

In "Outliers," the author explores the lives of successful outliers, such as geniuses, business tycoons, and rock stars, and argues that the way we perceive success is flawed. Society tends to focus on personal qualities, like intelligence and talent, as explanations for success, when in reality, external factors like family background, culture, and opportunity play a significant role. The author challenges the idea of the self-made man and argues that success is often a product of circumstance and hard work.

The idea of the self-made individual is flawed, and success is largely influenced by hidden advantages, extraordinary opportunities, and cultural legacies. The culture we belong to and the circumstances we grow up in shape our patterns of achievement. It is not enough to focus on personal qualities when explaining success. Instead, we must examine where successful people come from to understand the factors that contribute to their success. The ecology of an organism, or the environment in which it grows, also plays a significant role in its success.

The text is about how successful people come from a combination of factors such as their environment and luck, and not just their inherent qualities. The author uses the example of a hockey team roster to demonstrate this point.



 The phenomenon of relative age in hockey was first discovered by Canadian psychologist Roger Barnsley in the mid-1980s, when he noticed a large number of January, February, and March birth dates among hockey players. 

 Barnsley and colleagues gathered statistics on every player in the Ontario Junior Hockey League and found that there were nearly five and a half times as many players born in January as in November. 

 Relative age is a significant factor in the success of young athletes, as those born earlier in the year have a developmental advantage over those born later in the year.

In Canadian hockey, there is a disproportionate number of players born in the first few months of the year in elite teams. This trend is seen across age groups and levels of play. The phenomenon is so significant that it does not require statistical analysis to confirm. For example, 40% of elite players are born between January and March, while only 10% are born between October and December. This trend is illustrated by a team roster and a play-by-play of a game.

Canadian hockey has a disproportionate number of elite players born in the first few months of the year due to age-class eligibility cutoffs for preadolescent players. Coaches select bigger and more coordinated players who benefit from additional months of physical maturity. Selected players receive better coaching, teammates, and more playing time, resulting in a significant advantage by the age of thirteen or fourteen. There is nothing magical or astrological about this phenomenon.

Research shows that in sports such as hockey and baseball, where there is early selection, streaming, and differentiated experience, those born closest to the eligibility cutoff date have an advantage. In contrast, sports such as football and basketball in the United States do not exhibit such heavily skewed age distributions. European soccer is also similar to hockey and baseball in this regard, with the birth-date distributions heavily skewed. The eligibility date for international junior soccer is January 1.

Sports such as hockey and soccer exhibit biased age distributions due to eligibility cutoffs, which can also affect education. Parents with children born at the end of the calendar year may hold their children back before kindergarten, thinking that the disadvantage eventually goes away. However, this bias persists, locking children into patterns of achievement and underachievement. Two economists, Kelly Bedard and Elizabeth Dhuey, examined the relationship between age and scores on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.

A study found that the oldest fourth-graders scored significantly better than the youngest on math and science tests. This age difference can result in a substantial gap in percentiles and affect a child's placement in gifted programs. The study suggests that early ability grouping in childhood can be problematic as teachers may confuse maturity with ability, resulting in older children being placed in advanced groups where they continue to excel. Denmark is an exception as it has a policy of no ability grouping until age ten. Another study found that college students who are relatively young for their class are underrepresented by about 11.6 percent in four-year colleges in the United States, indicating that the initial disadvantage persists.

Arbitrary cutoff dates in school create long-lasting effects on children's success, as older children have an advantage over younger ones, and ability grouping can be problematic. The story of hockey players and their birthdays illustrates the Matthew Effect, where those who are successful are given special opportunities that lead to further success through accumulative advantage. The systems in place often prioritize those who are already successful, perpetuating inequality.

Efforts to identify and nurture talent in sports through early identification programs such as gifted programs and all-star leagues may not be effective as evidenced by the absence of players born in the last half of the year in the Czech Republic soccer team. These individuals may have been discouraged, overlooked or pushed out of the sport. However, they may excel in other sports such as hockey, as demonstrated by the 2007 Czech junior hockey team roster where several players were born in the last half of the year.

The way society thinks about success is problematic, as it leads to missed opportunities and rules that frustrate achievement. We are too quick to label people as failures and become passive in determining who succeeds. However, if we acknowledge the impact of birth cutoff dates, we could create separate leagues and classes for students born at different times of the year to level the playing field and allow for more opportunities for success. This could be applied not only in sports but in other areas as well.

The text discusses the ingredients for success in hockey, including passion, talent, hard work, and the eligibility date for Canadian hockey players. The story focuses on Scott Wasden and his father's nervousness before the Memorial Cup final. The text also mentions the 10,000-hour rule and the opening of the University of Michigan's new computer center in 1971.

The text describes the University of Michigan's Computer Center, which was state of the art in 1971, and its most famous student, Bill Joy. Joy was a gawky teenager who became hooked on programming and made it his life. He went on to enroll in graduate school at the University of California and collaborated on rewriting UNIX with a small group of programmers.

Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, is a highly influential figure in the modern history of computing. He wrote the operating system that runs on millions of computers worldwide and played a significant role in developing Java. The pure meritocracy of computer programming is often touted as a fair field, but the story of Joy's success suggests that opportunities and arbitrary advantages play a role in achieving success.

Psychologists have debated whether innate talent exists, with some believing preparation plays a bigger role. A study on violinists at an elite music academy found that, despite starting at the same age and practicing the same amount initially, the most successful violinists practiced significantly more hours than their peers as they got older, suggesting that preparation plays a larger role in success than innate talent.

A study by Ericsson and colleagues found that elite performers in music had practiced for over 30 hours per week by age 20, totaling 10,000 hours of practice, while good students had 8,000 hours and future music teachers had just over 4,000 hours. Professionals in music had also reached 10,000 hours of practice by age 20. The study suggests that hard work is the key factor distinguishing top performers from others and that excellence in complex tasks requires a critical minimum level of practice, which researchers believe to be 10,000 hours. No naturals or grinds were found in the study.

Studies show that it takes around 10,000 hours of practice to achieve world-class expertise in anything, and this holds true even for prodigies like Mozart, who did not produce his greatest work until he had been composing for more than twenty years. Becoming a chess grandmaster also takes about ten years. Bobby Fischer is the only one who achieved it in less time.

The article discusses the concept of "ten thousand hours" of hard practice as the magic number of greatness. Late-born prodigies in sports often miss out on the extra practice needed to reach this number, which is necessary to master skills at the top level. Ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time that is difficult to reach alone, requiring parental support and financial stability.

The article describes how Bill Joy, a math whiz with talent, stumbled upon a nondescript building where he had access to rare computers in the early 1970s when they were the size of rooms and programming was tedious. Computers were expensive and hard to access, and programming required the use of cardboard punch cards. Joy's development was due to his access to these resources, which allowed him to accumulate the necessary hours of practice to become a programming expert. Talent alone was not enough for his development.

Before the mid-1960s, programming was done using punched cards and required a long wait to receive feedback. Making a mistake meant redoing the entire process. However, the advent of time-sharing in the mid-1960s allowed for multiple users to work on a computer at once, eliminating the need for punched cards and allowing for interactive programming.

The University of Michigan was one of the first universities in the world to switch to time-sharing in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s, a hundred people could be programming simultaneously in the Computer Center. Bill Joy arrived at Michigan in 1971 and found himself in one of the few places in the world where a seventeen-year-old could program all he wanted. Time-sharing made programming fun and Joy spent a phenomenal amount of time at the Computer Center, even more than attending his classes.

The text describes how a bug in a university computer system gave Bill Joy the opportunity to practice programming for extended periods of time, which eventually led to him becoming an expert and being presented with the opportunity to rewrite UNIX. Joy's dedication to learning was a major factor in his success.

The text discusses the idea of the "ten-thousand-hour rule" for success, which suggests that individuals need to dedicate at least 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to achieve greatness. Bill Joy is cited as an example of someone who benefited from special opportunities for practice, and the Beatles and Bill Gates are used as examples to test the idea. The Beatles' long years of preparation and special opportunities for practice are highlighted.

In the early days of rock-and-roll, Hamburg had strip clubs instead of music clubs. One club owner named Bruno brought in rock groups to play nonstop shows, including many bands from Liverpool. The Beatles made a connection with Bruno and other club owners and kept going back for the amount of time they were forced to play, which helped them improve their performances. John Lennon stated that they had to try harder and put their heart and soul into it to get themselves over, as they had only ever done one-hour sessions in Liverpool.

The Beatles played for up to eight hours a night, seven nights a week, for a total of 270 nights in Hamburg, Germany between 1960 and 1962, performing an estimated 1200 times before their first success. They learned stamina and an enormous amount of songs, including cover versions of various genres. The Hamburg crucible was the making of them, and they came back sounding like no one else. The story of Bill Gates, a brilliant young math whiz who dropped out of Harvard to start a little computer company, is also well-known.

Bill Gates was a precocious child who attended Lakeside, a private school for Seattle's elite families, where a computer club was started midway through his second year. The school purchased an ASR-33 Teletype, a time-sharing terminal with a direct link to a mainframe computer, which allowed Gates to learn real-time programming in 1968 as an eighth grader. This early exposure to computing contributed to his success in co-founding Microsoft.

Gates and his friends taught themselves how to use the ASR-33 Teletype and obtained free programming time in exchange for testing software programs for C-Cubed and working on a payroll automation software for ISI. They spent up to eight hours a day, seven days a week programming and often got into trouble, such as stealing passwords and crashing the system. Gates' obsession with programming led him to skip athletics and spend all his time in the computer room.



 Bill Gates found free computer access at the University of Washington and would sneak out at night to use it. 

 His computer skills caught the attention of ISI founder Bud Pembroke, who recommended Gates and other Lakeside students to TRW for a specialized programming project at Bonneville Power station. 

 Gates convinced his teachers to let him do the project as an independent study during his senior year, and learned a lot about programming from supervisor John Norton. 

 Gates' opportunities during his high school years were exceptional and comparable to those of Bill Joy.



 Bill Gates had a series of lucky opportunities that allowed him extra time to practice programming, including attending Lakeside with a time-sharing terminal, access to computer fees, weekend work at C-Cubed, working on payroll software at ISI, living close to the University of Washington with free computer time, being recommended for a specialized programming project at TRW, and being allowed to spend his spring term writing code miles away from Lakeside. 

 These opportunities gave Gates an exceptional amount of programming experience by the time he dropped out of Harvard to start his own company. 

 Gates considers himself incredibly lucky to have had such exposure to software development at a young age.

Success of outliers like Bill Gates, Bill Joy, and the Beatles is not solely attributed to their talent but also to their extraordinary opportunities, which were often lucky breaks. Hidden opportunities also play a significant role in the success of outliers, as demonstrated by a calendar analysis of birth years and a list of the 75 richest people in human history.

The list shows the 35 richest people in history, including contemporary billionaires such as Carlos Slim and Warren Buffet, and historical figures such as Cleopatra and William II of England. The net worth of each person is calculated in current US dollars, and their source of wealth varies from monarchies to corporations.

The text lists the names of 67 wealthy individuals, their respective countries, and the companies they are associated with, ranging from Hetty Green in the US in the late 19th century to Ingvar Kamprad of Sweden.

The text includes a list of wealthy individuals with their countries and associated companies, and highlights that 14 of the 75 individuals are Americans born within nine years of each other in the mid-19th century. This can be explained by the significant transformation of the American economy during the period, characterized by the construction of railroads, emergence of Wall Street, and industrial manufacturing.

There was a nine-year window in the mid-19th century where individuals were born in the perfect time to take advantage of the paradigm shift happening at the time. Similarly, the most important date in the history of the personal computer revolution was in January 1975 when the Altair 8800 was introduced, and those born at the right time would have been in the best position to take advantage of the new technology.

If you were too old in 1975, having already established a career at IBM, you may have missed out on the personal computer revolution. Similarly, if you were too young, still in high school, you wouldn't have been in the perfect position to take advantage of the opportunity. The ideal age to have been born to be part of the revolution was in 1954 or 1955, which is Bill Gates' birth year. His best friend, Paul Allen, also shared those experiences and went on to found Microsoft with him.



Paul Allen was born on January 21, 1953 and Steve Ballmer on March 24, 1956. 

Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, grew up in Mountain View, California, where he had access to electronics hobbyists and engineers from Hewlett-Packard. 

As a teenager, Jobs attended talks by Hewlett-Packard scientists and even called Bill Hewlett for spare parts, which led to a summer job. Jobs' childhood experiences were extraordinary and helped him develop his passion for electronics and computers.



Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, and Bill Joy were pioneers of the software revolution born in 1955 and 1954. 

Their success was not solely due to individual merit but also a product of the world they grew up in. 

Bill Joy might have become a biologist had he been a little older and missed the opportunity to write supporting code for the internet. 

Joy later became one of the founders of Sun Microsystems.

The text mentions the birth dates of the founders of Sun Microsystems to highlight the importance of time and place in success. The text also discusses Christopher Langan, a man with an IQ of 195 who appeared on the television show 1 vs. 100 as a guest contestant, but despite his intelligence, he faced challenges competing against a group of clever individuals. The text suggests that having a high IQ is not necessarily enough to succeed in certain situations.

The text discusses Christopher Langan, a man with an extremely high IQ who has become famous as a celebrity outlier. Langan believes that having a high IQ can be a hindrance because it tends to encourage specialization and deep thinking. Langan achieved remarkable intellectual feats from a very young age, including teaching himself to read at five and reading complex theoretical physics books as a teenager. He has also received extremely high scores on IQ tests, including one that was specially designed for people too smart for ordinary tests.

Christopher Langan, who got a perfect SAT score, had an intense routine of studying math, French, Russian, and philosophy daily. He was also gifted in art and music, and rarely attended school. During a TV game show, Langan confidently answered questions and stopped playing after winning $250,000. The article also mentions Lewis Terman, a Stanford psychology professor who studied a gifted boy named Henry after World War I.

Lewis Terman, a Stanford psychology professor, created the Stanford-Binet IQ test and became fascinated with finding and studying gifted children. He found a janitor named Cowell, who had an IQ above 140 despite being unschooled since age seven. Terman put together a team of fieldworkers to identify and test the brightest students in Californian schools and selected 1,470 gifted children to study.

Lewis Terman conducted a famous psychological study on a group of young geniuses called the Termites, who had high IQs ranging from 140 to 200. Terman tracked and tested them throughout their lives, recording their achievements, illnesses, and psychological health. Terman believed that high IQ individuals were important for producing leaders in science, art, government, education, and social welfare. He believed his Termites were destined to be the future elite of the United States, and their achievements proved it. Today, many of Terman's ideas remain influential.

High intelligence is believed to be important for success, with schools and universities having programs for the gifted, and high-tech companies measuring cognitive abilities of prospective employees. However, the author argues that extraordinary achievement is more about opportunity than talent, and being a genius doesn't guarantee success. The author highlights the error of Lewis Terman, who believed his Termites were destined to be the future elite of the US, and argues that understanding outliers requires a deeper understanding of opportunity and context.



Ravens Progressive Matrices is a widely used intelligence test that measures abstract reasoning skills. 

IQ is calculated based on the number of items answered correctly, with a score of 100 being average. 

Higher IQ scores are associated with more education, higher income, and longer life, but this relationship only holds up to an IQ of around 120. 

People with extremely high IQs, such as Chris Langan, have minds that can figure out complex puzzles. 

IQ is not the only factor that determines real-life success, and a score of at least 115 is generally required for success in a competitive graduate program.



IQ is like height in basketball, where a certain threshold is necessary but beyond that point, it stops mattering as much. 

While a higher IQ is generally associated with better thinking ability, the relationship breaks down when comparing two people with relatively high IQs. 

Intelligence has a threshold, and beyond that point, additional IQ points do not necessarily translate into greater thinking ability. 

The IQ of a Nobel Prize winner is not necessarily the highest imaginable, and a high IQ does not guarantee success in academia or science.

The undergraduate colleges attended by the last 25 American Nobel Prize winners in Medicine and Chemistry include a mix of prestigious universities and lesser-known colleges. The list suggests that attending a top-ranked university is not a requirement for winning a Nobel Prize, but rather being smart enough to attend a good school. This challenges the conventional notion that attending an elite university is necessary for success.

The idea that schools can be ranked by intelligence is challenged by the fact that future Nobel Prize winners come from a variety of schools. Elite schools should consider a simpler admissions process, like a lottery for all those above a certain threshold of ability. Affirmative action policies in elite educational institutions have shown the "threshold effect" in action, where students admitted with lower grades and test scores still perform well academically.

White students generally perform better than minority students in law school due to better academic credentials, making affirmative action controversial. However, a study by the University of Michigan found that minority law school graduates were just as successful as their white peers in the real world, indicating that their academic credentials did not hinder their success.

Intelligence matters only up to a point, and beyond that, other things such as creativity become more important. Divergence tests, which require using imagination and producing unique responses, measure creativity rather than analytical intelligence. The example of a brick and a blanket is given to illustrate this point. Responses to such tests can be as challenging as those to analytical tests.

The article contrasts the imaginative answers of a student named Poole with those of a high-IQ student named Florence when asked about the various uses of bricks and blankets. Poole's answers are more creative and varied, while Florence's are more functional and predictable. The article suggests that Poole's ability to make unconventional connections and come up with new ideas may be more valuable in certain contexts than simply having a high IQ.

The article suggests that success in fields such as law and Nobel Prize-winning research requires more than just high IQ scores, and that unconventional thinking and creativity may be more valuable traits. The article cites examples of successful individuals who may not have scored highly on traditional IQ tests, and critiques the narrow focus on IQ in past studies such as Terman's study of child geniuses.

Pitirim Sorokin found that a group of randomly selected children with similar family backgrounds as Terman's gifted group could perform almost as impressively. Terman's fourth volume of Genetic Studies of Genius revealed disappointment that intellect and achievement were not perfectly correlated. Chris Langan, with exceptional intelligence and linguistic ability, is unlikely to be a true outlier without further knowledge about him. Langan's impoverished family background includes a mother with four sons from different fathers, one of whom was a failed journalist named Jack Langan.

Chris Langan grew up in poverty, with an absent father and a troubled family. His stepfather, Jack Langan, was abusive and would disappear on drinking sprees. The family moved around frequently, living in poverty on an Indian reservation and in small towns. Chris was gifted but not recognized by his school in Bozeman, Montana. To defend himself and his brothers, Chris began weightlifting and knocked out his stepfather when he was fourteen. Chris received full scholarship offers from Reed College and the University of __.

Chris had culture shock when he attended Reed College in Chicago and struggled to fit in with the long-haired city kids. He lost his scholarship due to his mother's mistake, and Reed College showed no concern for their students. Chris left Reed before the final set of exams and earned Fs on his transcript. He worked in construction and as a forest services firefighter before enrolling at Montana State University.

Chris Langans' car broke down and he asked his adviser and dean to transfer him to afternoon classes due to his car problem, but both denied his request, causing him to drop out of college. This experience represented a turning point in his life, as he had dreamt of becoming an academic but found the higher-education system repugnant.

Christopher Langan, a man with high IQ but without a college degree, struggled to find his place in the world and worked odd jobs while pursuing his interest in philosophy, mathematics, and physics. He wrote a treatise called the CTMU but fears that his lack of academic credentials will prevent him from being published in a scholarly journal. Langan's story is described as heartbreaking, and he admits that being a full professor at Harvard would be an ideal situation for him.

Christopher Langan expresses a desire to live in a stimulating intellectual environment but also criticizes institutions like Harvard for prioritizing profit over truth and knowledge. However, his explanations for his struggles, including not receiving a scholarship due to his mother's mistake and not being allowed to switch class times, seem strange. Additionally, he may not fully understand the culture and workings of institutions he critiques.

The article discusses the story of Chris Langan, a genius who chose to work as a college professor instead of pursuing a higher-paying job in the private industry for the freedom it provides. The author compares Langan's story to that of Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist who struggled with depression and attempted to poison his tutor while studying at Cambridge University. Oppenheimer's story is described as unbelievable, as the university negotiated with him instead of expelling him for the crime.

The article contrasts the different outcomes of two brilliant young students who faced problems that imperiled their college careers. Chris Langan lost his scholarship after his mother missed a financial aid deadline, while Robert Oppenheimer was put on probation and required to see a psychiatrist after attempting to poison his tutor. Despite his lack of experience and practical skills, Oppenheimer was appointed as scientific director of the Manhattan Project, despite his questionable political affiliations and attempted crime in graduate school.

Oppenheimer convinced General Groves to support his idea of a central laboratory to work on the atomic bomb project by appealing to his engineering background and practical problem-solving approach. Oppenheimer's success in getting what he wanted from the world was due to his savvy. Chris Langan, a genius with a high IQ, struggled to adapt to college because of his inability to navigate social and bureaucratic challenges.

Chris Langan, a calculus prodigy, failed to communicate his talent to his professor due to his lack of practical intelligence, which includes knowing how to read situations correctly and get what you want. Practical intelligence is a type of intelligence that is separate from analytical ability measured by IQ. Robert Oppenheimer possessed both analytical and practical intelligence.

Analytical intelligence is partly genetic, but social savvy and practical intelligence come from learning skills and attitudes from family. Sociologist Annette Lareau conducted a study of twelve families and found that parenting philosophies largely divide along class lines, with wealthier parents heavily involved in their children's free time and activities.

The parenting philosophies of wealthier and poorer families largely divide along class lines, with wealthier parents heavily involved in their children's activities, while poorer children engage in more informal play. Middle-class parents talk things through with their children, reasoning with them and expecting them to question authority, and intervene on behalf of their kids. Poorer parents see their children's skills and interests as character traits, rather than as signals to develop formal talents. One wealthier mother intervenes to get her daughter admitted to a gifted program.

The article discusses different parenting styles among poor and middle-class families. Poor parents tend to be more passive and believe it's the teachers' job to manage their children's education, while middle-class parents actively foster and assess their children's talents and skills. Although both styles have their pros and cons, concerted cultivation has practical advantages, such as teaching children teamwork, how to cope in structured settings, and a sense of entitlement. However, poorer children often have better behavior, creativity, and independence. Lareau emphasizes that neither style is morally better than the other.

The article discusses how middle-class children have a sense of entitlement, whereas working-class and poor children are characterized by distance, distrust, and constraint. Middle-class children know how to get their way and customize their environment, while poorer children do not. A telling scene involves a wealthy nine-year-old boy named Alex Williams and his mother visiting a doctor. Alex's mother encourages him to speak up and assert himself, which he does by interrupting the doctor to mention his height percentile.

The text discusses an interaction between a doctor and a young boy named Alex. Despite being graphed at a younger age than his current age, Alex confidently interrupts the doctor to ask about bumps on his arms. This behavior is attributed to the strategy of concerted cultivation, in which children are taught to assert themselves with authority figures and are treated with respect and attention. Alex's behavior is seen as a demonstration of his mastery of this strategy.

The text argues that the ability to interact with authority figures is a cultural advantage taught by educated families, rather than an inherited trait or a racial characteristic. This advantage, known as concerted cultivation, involves teaching children to assert themselves and giving them a sense of entitlement that is well-suited to succeeding in the modern world. The example of Alex Williams, a black child from an educated family, is used to illustrate this advantage. The childhood of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was raised in a wealthy and educated family that practiced concerted cultivation, is also discussed.

J. Robert Oppenheimer impressed geologists with his knowledge of rock formations at the age of twelve, giving a successful lecture with the support of his father's encouragement. Oppenheimer's upbringing and education prepared him to handle life's challenges, while Chris Langan's bleak home environment resulted in resentment towards authority figures.

Chris Langan's upbringing in Bozeman, with little exposure to entitlement and no guidance on navigating authority figures, was a handicap in his adult life. He struggled to navigate the process of applying for financial aid, and his boredom in school hindered his potential. Terman's study of 730 "Termites" found that the top 20% achieved significant success, while the bottom 150 did not fulfill their potential.

Terman's study compared two groups of highly intelligent individuals, the "As" and the "Cs." The main difference between the two groups was their family background, with the As coming from middle and upper-class families and the Cs from less privileged backgrounds. The As were found to have better personalities and mannerisms, likely due to their upbringing in an atmosphere of concerted cultivation. The study highlights the importance of family background and the potential for talented individuals from less privileged backgrounds to be overlooked.

The Terman study showed that gifted children from lower socio-economic backgrounds often did not reach their potential due to a lack of community support. The story of Chris Langan, a highly intelligent individual living on a horse farm in Missouri, highlights the importance of nurturing talent through a supportive community. Langan has a daily routine of working on intellectual pursuits and values the role of curiosity and questioning in his life.

The article profiles Chris Langan, a genius with extraordinary intellectual abilities who lives on a horse farm in northern Missouri. Despite his exceptional mind, he has struggled to have his work published and recognized by academics. Langan believes he is the smartest person alive and is open to anyone challenging him. He acknowledges that he hasn't pursued mainstream publishers or agents as aggressively as he should have and feels frustrated by his lack of impact on the world.

The article discusses how even geniuses like Chris Langan need help along the way, but Langan had to make his way alone. The article then introduces Joe Flom, the last living named partner of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, who grew up in poverty during the Depression in Brooklyn. Flom later attended an elite public high school in Manhattan that produced several notable alumni.

Joe Flom, who wanted to be a lawyer since he was six years old, worked during the day and went to night school at City College in Manhattan. He served in the army, then applied to Harvard Law School, despite not having a college degree. At Harvard, he was named to the Law Review and had the capacity for judgment, although he did not take notes. After being rejected by big corporate law firms, he was offered a job by a new firm, which he eventually turned into Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, now one of the world's most successful law firms.

Joe Flom took a chance on a new law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, and became their associate in 1948. He became the managing partner in 1954, and the firm grew rapidly to become one of the world's largest and most successful law firms. Flom never lacked ambition, and the firm now has nearly 2,000 attorneys in 23 offices around the world, earning well over $1 billion a year. Flom has represented many Fortune 500 companies and has been a powerful figure in the legal world for nearly 30 years. However, the article cautions readers to be skeptical of this type of story.

The text discusses the idea that successful people don't achieve success alone, but rather are products of their environment. The author explores the background of Joseph Flom, a successful lawyer, and aims to identify the conditions that helped create him by examining the New York immigrant world he grew up in. The true story of Flom's life is more intriguing than the mythological version because his apparent disadvantages, such as being poor and Jewish during a time of discrimination, ended up being unexpected advantages.

The text discusses the story of Joe Flom, an outlier in the legal profession who provides a blueprint for understanding success in his field. Lesson Number One is the importance of being Jewish, as exemplified by Flom's classmate Alexander Bickel, who like Flom was the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, attended public school in New York, and was a star in his law school class. Bickel's job search at Mudge Rose, a traditional and stuffy law firm, is described.

Bickel, a successful lawyer who had argued before the Supreme Court and written books, was rejected by Mudge Rose, an old-line law firm in New York, because of his immigrant background. The interviewer is surprised by this, but Bickel explains that in the 1940s and 1950s, these firms operated like a private club, only hiring those from Ivy League schools and certain social backgrounds. This led to the term "white-shoe firms."

In the 1940s and 1950s, old-line law firms in New York only hired lawyers who were Nordic, had the right social background and education, and had "acceptability," a combination of family connections, ability, and personality. Bickel and Flom, who were not from the right background or religion, had to settle for second-rate law firms or start their own businesses. However, this setback was actually a golden opportunity for them.

Old-line Wall Street law firms focused on corporate legal work, including taxes and securities, but not litigation or hostile takeovers. They settled disputes in conference rooms, not courtrooms. Hostile takeovers were considered scandalous and not gentlemanly. The firms avoided involvement in such deals and preferred to maintain relationships with their clients.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Jewish lawyers from the Bronx and Brooklyn focused on litigation and proxy fights, which were at the center of hostile takeovers. Joe Flom became the go-to lawyer for such cases, excelling in the "snake pit" of proxy contests. These contests were informal, contentious, and sometimes unruly, with lawyers vying for the appointment of inspectors who were beholden to them. Flom was known for his ability to win these fights despite being physically unattractive and indifferent to social niceties.

Joseph Flom was a highly successful lawyer known for his aggressive tactics in corporate takeovers. He was often called upon by white-shoe law firms to handle proxy fights for their establishment clients. In the 1970s, there was a boom in corporate takeovers, and Flom's expertise was in high demand. He helped defend companies against lawsuits and beat back hostile suitors. Investors and shareholders also sought his legal expertise.

From the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s, the amount of money involved in mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street increased by 2,000%. The once marginal law firms that specialized in hostile takeovers and litigation became in high demand, and Joseph Flom, who perfected his craft at Skadden, Arps, was ready for the opportunity. Demographic luck played a role in the success of Maurice Janklow, an immigrant's eldest son who enrolled in Brooklyn Law School in 1919.

Maurice Janklow, an educated lawyer who came from a family with a business background, struggled to succeed in his career despite his qualifications and opportunities. His son, Mort Janklow, on the other hand, built a successful law firm, sold a cable TV franchise for a fortune, and established a prestigious literary agency. The reasons for their differing success are unknown, but the son achieved the dreams that eluded the father.

The success of Mort Janklow and Joe Flom can be partly attributed to being born after the Great Depression and World War II, which provided more opportunities for education and career advancement. The Terman genius study found that children from wealthier families were more likely to succeed, but also revealed that those born after 1912 had better outcomes due to historical events. Those born before 1911 faced challenges entering the job market during the Depression and were already in their late thirties when WWII began.

Those born before 1911 were unlucky due to being drafted during World War II, disrupting their established lives. Jewish lawyers in New York were largely solo practitioners, and during the Depression, their income sharply decreased, with many qualifying for work relief. Maurice Janklow, a Jewish lawyer born in 1902, lost his fortune in the Depression and became a scrivener-type lawyer. He lacked the courage to take risks after that and closed titles for $25.

Maurice Janklow worked for very low pay as a lawyer during the Depression era, struggling financially. Mort Janklow, who was born in the 1930s, had a different experience due to the demographic trough caused by families having fewer children during the Depression. He was born into a generation that received more attention and resources, such as well-appointed hospitals with more attentive staff.

The article discusses how a small cohort of children born in the early 1930s in New York City benefited from a low supply of new job entrants and ample resources in education, leading to the city's public schools being considered the best in the country in the 1940s. Educators who were unable to secure high-status jobs became teachers, and the resulting abundance of teachers and facilities benefited students. These students went on to have success in higher education and the job market.

The article discusses how Ted Friedman, a successful New York litigator, was able to attend the University of Michigan during a time when college was free and jobs were plentiful, even for economically disadvantaged students. Friedman worked multiple jobs, including waiting tables and working at a Ford plant, to put himself through school. The article suggests that Friedman's success was due in part to his hard work and initiative, but also to the favorable economic conditions of the time.

Mort Janklow, a successful lawyer, had easy access to good education in the 1950s. He graduated from a public high school in New York, and had free or affordable options for college. He hitchhiked to college and got good jobs to pay his way. The sense of possibility for success comes from both internal factors and the particular opportunities presented by one's time in history. Janklow now has a successful career and a luxurious office.

Mort Janklow is a risk-taker who had access to better education and opportunities than his father Maurice. The Janklow family's story illustrates the impact of generational limitations on success. Mort Janklow's parents' generation endured significant hardships, including the 1918 flu epidemic and World Wars. Mort Janklow's success was possible because of his time in history, and he sold his cable business for millions of dollars. The garment industry provided meaningful work for many immigrants, including Louis and Regina Borgenicht, who migrated to America in 1889.

Louis and Regina immigrated to New York with little money and settled in a small apartment. Louis started selling herring on the street but later became a pushcart peddler selling various items. After struggling to find a sustainable business, he finally found success selling lace to women's garment manufacturers.

Borgenicht, a clothing manufacturer, was inspired by the abundance of ready-made clothing in America and took notes on what people were wearing and what was for sale. He sought to find a novel item and discovered the idea of a tiny embroidered apron. He bought fabric and made aprons with his wife using their sewing machine, which led to the success of his clothing business.

Regina Flom and her son Louis, Jewish immigrants, started their own business selling children's aprons on Hester Street in New York City. Jews who immigrated to America had urban trades and professions, and many had experience in the clothing trade, such as tailors and dressmakers. Louis had worked as a salesclerk in a general store in Poland before coming to America.

Louis Borgenicht, a Jewish immigrant in the clothing trade, learned about different fabrics while working in piece goods for a man named Epstein and later for a store called Brandstatters. He and his wife Regina opened small piece-goods stores and eventually started their own apron business, drawing on their experience in the clothing industry. Thousands of other Jewish immigrants did the same, leading to Eastern European newcomers dominating the garment industry in New York City.

Immigrants like the Borgenichts brought valuable dressmaking and sewing skills to the garment trade, which was the largest industry in New York City from the late 19th to mid-20th century. The industry's growth created a golden opportunity for immigrants who possessed these skills, and their hard work, sacrifice, and wise investment led to success for them and their descendants. The lessons learned from the garment workers were critical for future generations.

Louis and Regina Borgenicht, Jewish immigrants with dressmaking and sewing skills, started their business with $12 by making and selling aprons in New York City in 1890. Their hard work and expanding product line led to a growing list of customers, their own factory, and 20 employees within two years. The Borgenichts reinvested profits back into the business and were barely wealthy, but they were already in charge of a successful business.

The garment industry in early 20th century New York was entrepreneurial, with established firms designing patterns and sending out the stitching to small contractors. The low threshold for entry into the business allowed many small companies to thrive, resulting in approximately 16,000 separate companies by 1913. The industry was built on sewing machines, which were affordable and allowed contractors to make some profit despite low margins. One contractor, Borgenicht, expanded beyond aprons to produce popular-priced children's dresses that could sell to both large and small stores in both urban and rural areas.

Borgenicht convinced wholesalers to sell cloth to him directly, allowing him to undercut bigger firms. He learned market research, manufacturing, negotiating, and understanding fashion trends. Unlike other immigrants, Borgenicht had a skill specific to the urban economy, while others went to work in jobs where they didn't learn these skills.

The text discusses the experiences of Mexican immigrants who came to California to work in agriculture and garment industries in the early 20th century. While conditions in both industries were poor, working in the garment industry offered more autonomy and the ability to see how to set up one's own job. Autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward are considered the three qualities necessary for fulfilling work. Money is not the sole factor in job satisfaction, and creative work that fulfills these criteria is often valued more highly than higher-paying jobs without these qualities.

The text argues that meaningful work is important and that hard work becomes fulfilling when it has meaning. The garment industry provided an opportunity for immigrants to find meaningful work, and their success served as inspiration for their children. The text highlights the importance of using one's mind and imagination to shape the world to one's desires. It briefly mentions a sociology graduate student's visit to nursing homes and residential hotels in 1982.

The article discusses a genealogist named Stephen Farkas who created family trees of Jewish immigrants to New York, showing how humble origins led to professional success. Examples of success stories include a Russian tailor who started in a sweatshop and eventually opened a successful menswear store with his sons, and a tanner who emigrated from Poland and had descendants who became educated professionals. The article also mentions how a poor family was able to attend concerts at Carnegie Hall by giving a quarter to a ticket taker named Mary.

The article explores the connection between Jewish immigrants' humble beginnings in the garment industry and their children's success in the professions. The author cites examples of prominent lawyers and professionals, including Joe Flom, whose father sewed shoulder pads for women's dresses, and Robert Oppenheimer, whose father was a garment manufacturer. The article also highlights the story of a Romanian Jewish family who owned a small grocery store in the Old Country and opened another one in New York. The author notes that the garment industry was like "boot camp for the professions" and taught people the value of persuasion and initiative.

The Black Rock law firm operates only out of one Manhattan building, charges a fixed fee, turns down more business than it accepts, and has made the most money lawyer for lawyer over the past two decades. Success in the legal profession is not a random act, but arises from predictable circumstances and opportunities. The perfect lawyer is likely born in a demographic trough, Jewish, with parents who did meaningful work in the garment business, and attended a good school.

To be a great New York lawyer, it's advantageous to be an outsider, have parents who did meaningful work, and be born in the early 1930s. The birth year of 1930 is the perfect year for a Jewish lawyer as they would benefit from a small generation and a healthy Hamburg period during the revolution in the legal world. The Black Rock law firm (Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz) was founded by Herbert Wachtell and Martin Lipton, both born in 1931 to Jewish immigrant parents and attended public schools before going to law school.

The text introduces four partners who grew up poor in the Bronx, all attended New York City public schools, City College, and New York University Law School. Despite not fitting the stereotypical profile of a successful lawyer, their cultural and family backgrounds provided them with unique opportunities. The second part of the text describes the Cumberland Plateau in Kentucky, a mountainous region with a small town called Harlan.

Harlan County in Kentucky has a diverse array of trees, wildlife, and natural resources, including coal. The county was founded by immigrant families in the early 1800s, and for its first century, it was sparsely populated and difficult to access. The two founding families, the Howards and the Turners, had a long-standing feud, which brought attention to the otherwise remote and unknown town.

The Turner family in Harlan, Virginia were known for their violent behavior and ability to intimidate their neighbors. The family was involved in a series of conflicts with their neighbors, including a deadly shooting over a game of poker between two Turner grandsons and a retaliatory attack on the Howard family. The conflicts escalated into a series of deadly shootings, resulting in the deaths of multiple people from both families. The violence continued until a posse was sent out in search of the Howards, leading to another deadly gunfight. Wilse Howard, a member of the Howard family, ultimately attacked the Turner home before being ambushed himself, leading to another death.

The Howard-Turner feud in Harlan, Kentucky was marked by extreme violence, with multiple deadly shootings between the two families. Even with careful investigation, the specific causes and events of the feud would be difficult to determine. However, when viewed in a broader perspective, it becomes clear that such violent conflicts were not unique to Harlan, but rather a common occurrence in small towns throughout the Appalachian region, as seen in other well-known feuds such as the Hatfield-McCoy and French-Eversole feuds.

Feuds were common in Kentucky in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with many resulting in violence and death. The Martin-Tolliver feud featured several gunfights and ambushes, while the Baker-Howard feud lasted over a century. A circuit court clerk's office contained 1,000 murder indictments in a region with a population of 15,000. Feuds often disrupted court proceedings and resulted in vigilantism.

The Appalachian region was affected by a culture of honor, which tended to take root in highlands and marginal areas where farming was difficult. This culture arose from the need for herders to protect their animals from theft and damage, leading to a focus on reputation and the willingness to fight to defend it. Quarrels were seen as a critical moment in establishing a young herder's reputation, as they had to be publicly defended.

The Appalachian region was settled by Scotch-Irish immigrants from violent and lawless territories in Europe, who brought their culture of honor and violence with them. They were clannish and placed loyalty to blood above all else. The remote and rugged environment of the American backcountry suited their family system, warrior ethic, farming and herding economy, and attitudes towards land and wealth. The region was dangerous and lacked established government or the rule of law, making the borderers more at home than others.

The culture of honor brought by Scotch-Irish immigrants to the American backcountry was well adapted to the raw and dangerous environment, and it became dominant. This culture of honor helps to explain the distinctive pattern of criminality in the American South, with higher murder rates but lower rates of property crimes and stranger crimes. Violence was personal and fought over honor. The story of a man who killed his tormenters with a shotgun illustrates this culture of honor.

The article discusses the concept of a "culture of honor" and how it can influence behavior in certain communities. It argues that understanding the origins and history of a culture is important in understanding its values and practices. The article also highlights an experiment conducted by psychologists in the 1990s to study the presence of remnants of the culture of honor in modern society.

Psychologists conducted an experiment in which they insulted a group of young men by calling them "asshole" in a narrow hallway. They wanted to measure the participants' level of anger and physiological responses, including grip strength and hormone levels. The experiment aimed to determine if remnants of the culture of honor, which can lead to violent behavior, still exist in modern society.

Steve's fiancée, Jill, informs him that Larry has made passes at her despite knowing about their engagement. Steve keeps an eye on Larry and sees him try to kiss Jill. A study showed that the response to insults differed based on where the young men were from. Most northerners treated the incident with amusement, while southerners were angrier, with increased cortisol and testosterone levels. A game was played to measure their aggression, and results showed southerners to be more aggressive.

The study showed that southerners exhibited more aggression and deference than northerners, with a "culture of honor" in action. The southerners' behavior was not dependent on their ancestors or social class, as even upper-middle-class southerners acted similarly.

Cultural legacies are powerful and persist over generations, directing attitudes and behavior. The book Outliers explores how cultural legacies play a role in success and whether they can help us understand why people succeed. Chapter 7, "The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes," examines the impact of cultural legacies on the aviation industry and the factors that contribute to plane crashes. The chapter focuses on the importance of communication and teamwork in preventing crashes.

The chapter discusses the events leading up to the crash of Korean Air flight 801, including the captain's experience, the plane's condition, and the crew's descent toward Guam airport. The landing gear was deployed, and the flaps were extended, but the crew could not see the runway due to heavy rain. The Ground Proximity Warning System alerted them to their altitude, but they continued their descent and crashed into a hill. The chapter explores the cultural factors that contributed to the crash, including the captain's reluctance to challenge authority and the co-pilot's deference to the captain.



 Korean Air Flight 801 crashed into a mountain in Guam, killing 228 out of 254 people on board after the captain was slow to respond to instructions to abort landing. 

 Prior to this crash, Korean Air had a history of accidents, including one in which a plane was shot down, and several other crashes. 

 In comparison, the loss rate for United Airlines during the same period was much lower.



 Korean Air had a history of frequent plane crashes, with a loss rate 17 times higher than United Airlines in the same period. 

 The National Transportation Safety Board investigating the Guam crash had to include an addendum listing new Korean Air accidents that occurred since the investigation began. 

 Delta Air Lines, Air France, and the US Army suspended partnerships with Korean Air, while the US Federal Aviation Administration downgraded South Korea's safety rating. 

 An external audit of Korean Air's operations was leaked, which was denounced by the airline's officials as sensationalized.

Korean Air had a poor safety record and reputation due to instances of misconduct and poor training standards. After a plane crash in 1997, the Korean president spoke out and switched to a competitor airline. However, Korean Air turned itself around and is now a member of the SkyTeam alliance with a spotless safety record. The chapter will investigate how the company transformed itself from a poor outlier to a top airline.

Korean Air's success was tied to acknowledging its cultural legacy. Plane crashes are typically not caused by a single catastrophic event, but rather an accumulation of minor difficulties and errors, with the typical accident involving seven consecutive human errors.

The main cause of plane crashes is errors in teamwork and communication between pilots, rather than technical maneuvers. Two-person operation of the flight deck is intended to improve safety through mutual participation and checking. The Avianca flight 052 crash in 1990 serves as an example of modern plane crashes, which is studied in flight schools due to its similarity to later crashes. The crash was caused by poor weather conditions and errors in communication between the captain and first officer.

Avianca Flight 052 was delayed three times due to poor weather conditions before being cleared for landing at Kennedy Airport. Severe wind shear caused the plane to go too fast for landing, and the malfunctioning autopilot failed to react. After a go-around, both engines failed, and the plane crashed into a residential area in Long Island due to fuel exhaustion. Seventy-three of the 158 passengers died, and the cause of the crash was determined quickly.

The Avianca plane crash was caused by a series of factors including a nor'easter, delayed flight, technical malfunction, and long holding patterns resulting in the plane running out of fuel. The plane was an older model with manual flight controls that required significant physical effort to fly. The captain was maxed out and had no resources left to make good decisions due to fatigue. The analysis of how humans interact with complex systems played a role in understanding the crash.

The captain of the Avianca flight appeared exhausted during the final hour of the flight, as evident from his repeated requests for directions to be translated into Spanish and his failure to ask to land at Philadelphia despite its proximity. He also ignored the Ground Proximity Warning System's repeated warnings and failed to circle back around immediately after aborting the landing. The first officer's behavior was also oddly passive, and he did not communicate the fuel shortage issue until the third holding pattern. The cockpit was filled with heavy silence, and the crew seemed to assume that they were being given priority by air traffic control. The captain's fatigue likely played a significant role in the crash.

The pilots of a plane misunderstood instructions and ended up waiting in the wrong queue. They did not raise the issue or mention fuel for 38 minutes. The captain talks about a previous incident where he had to make a difficult decision while flying due to a sick passenger. He chose to land heavy instead of dumping fuel, which would have taken too long and risked the passenger's life.

The captain took over control of the plane during a difficult landing due to excess weight. He coordinated with other pilots and personnel to ensure a safe landing in an unfamiliar airport. The weather in Helsinki was favorable, but it was still a challenging situation that required technical skill and coordination.

The success of an emergency landing involved more than piloting skills. The pilot had to weigh risks, consider airport capabilities, and communicate effectively with passengers, crew, and superiors. Communication was crucial, including sharing information clearly and transparently. In contrast, the transcript of a failed landing showed long silences and a less effective form of communication.

During a failed landing attempt, the Avianca 052 pilots were running low on fuel and experiencing communication issues. The captain was desperate, but Klotz's response to Air Traffic Control was routine and did not convey the seriousness of the situation. Klotz's use of "running out of fuel" was unclear and his sentence structure and tone undermined the importance of his message. Air traffic controllers hear pilots talking about fuel all the time, and Klotz's message was not taken seriously.

The text discusses the concept of mitigated speech, which refers to downplaying or sugarcoating what is being said, and how it can be appropriate in certain situations but problematic in others, such as a cockpit during a storm. The linguists Ute Fischer and Judith Orasanu presented a hypothetical scenario to pilots to explore different levels of mitigation when trying to persuade a pilot to change course and avoid bad weather. The different levels of mitigation ranged from a direct command to a crew suggestion.

The text discusses how pilots use mitigated speech to communicate with their colleagues and superiors in the cockpit. A study by linguists Ute Fischer and Judith Orasanu found that captains tended to issue direct commands, while first officers used hints and suggestions due to their subordinate position. However, hints can be difficult to decode and refuse, as seen in the 1982 Air Florida crash where the first officer tried to alert the captain of dangerous ice on the wings using hints before upgrading to a crew suggestion. The last statement made by the first officer before the crash was a simple statement of fact.

Mitigation is a major cause of plane crashes and occurs when the less experienced co-pilot fails to speak up to the more experienced captain. Crew Resource Management training has been implemented by major airlines to combat mitigation by teaching clear and assertive communication, such as a standardized procedure for co-pilots to challenge the pilot. The success of this training has contributed to the decline in airline accidents in recent years. One airline encourages the use of first names between the first officer and the captain to facilitate communication.

The captain of an airplane tries to mitigate their seniority by encouraging co-pilots to speak up and using a self-deprecating tone. In the cockpit of the Avianca 052, the captain fails to communicate the severity of their situation to air traffic controllers, using mitigating language and failing to use the word "emergency." The crew's errors continue to accumulate, leading to a tragic outcome.

The text describes a conversation between the pilots of Avianca Flight 052 and air traffic control before the plane runs out of fuel and crashes. The author notes that New York air traffic controllers are known for being aggressive and handling a lot of traffic in a complex environment. The author shares a story about a pilot getting lost at JFK airport and the controller's response. The author emphasizes the importance of pilots pushing back against controller instructions if necessary.

The text discusses how New York air traffic control can be intimidating, and how Avianca Flight 052's pilots were likely overwhelmed by the rapid fire of communication. The article also highlights the importance of communication between pilots and air traffic control, and how cultural differences may have contributed to the crash. One of the pilots, Ratwatte, is described as having a different perspective and approach to flying.

The text discusses the different attitudes and behaviors of cultures around the world, based on the research of Geert Hofstede. Hofstede developed dimensions to analyze cultural differences, such as individualism-collectivism and uncertainty avoidance. The United States ranks high in individualism and low in universal healthcare, while Guatemala ranks low in individualism. Greece, Portugal, and Guatemala rank highest in uncertainty avoidance, while Hong Kong, Sweden, and Denmark rank lowest. Hofstede's research does not suggest a right or wrong place for cultures to be on these dimensions.

The text discusses how cultural tendencies and assumptions are specific to each community, and how Geert Hofstede's dimensions of culture can reveal these differences. While personality is unique to each person, cultural tendencies are handed down by the history of the community. Despite similarities between neighboring countries like Denmark and Belgium, their differences in history, politics, and religion affect how they deal with uncertainty. The Power Distance Index, which measures attitudes toward hierarchy, is one of Hofstede's most interesting dimensions.



Hofstede asked questions about power distance and cultural differences, such as how frequently employees are afraid to express disagreement with their managers and how power is distributed unequally. 

In low power distance index countries, power is something of which power holders are almost ashamed, and they may try to underplay their power. 

Leaders in low power distance index countries may renounce formal symbols to enhance their informal status. 

Hofstede's findings had an effect on the aviation industry's battle over mitigated speech and teamwork, as reducing power distance in the cockpit was attempted. 

Hofstede's work suggested that the task of convincing first officers to assert themselves depended a lot on their culture's power distance rating.



America is a low power distance culture, while Colombia is at the other end of the power distance scale. 

After the Avianca crash, psychologist Robert Helmreich argued that understanding Klotz's behavior required taking into account his Colombian nationality and high respect for authority. 

Helmreich suggested that the high power distance of Colombians may have created frustration for the first officer, who expected autocratic decision-making from the captain. 

Klotz saw himself as a subordinate and waited for the captain to make decisions, while the Kennedy Airport air traffic controllers did not see any hierarchical gap between themselves and the pilots in the air. 

Mitigated speech from a pilot did not indicate to the low power distance New Yorker controllers that the speaker was being subordinate.

The text discusses a cultural miscommunication that occurred between a pilot and controllers before a plane crash. The pilot, Klotz, followed the cultural dynamic of deferring to superiors despite feeling hurt and unable to communicate his plight. The management of the airline involved in the crash held a postmortem and concluded that previous accidents also had to do with communication issues between copilots and captains, where copilots failed to assert their concerns due to fear of appearing rebellious or foolish.

The success of pilots is influenced by their cultural background, particularly the power distance index (PDI). High PDI cultures can make it difficult for pilots to advocate for their opinions. The National Transportation Safety Board investigates plane crashes using a team of engineers, pilots, and psychologists to reconstruct the events leading up to the crash. Malcolm Brenner, a leading black-box specialist, investigated the Korean Air crash in Guam and noted that cultural factors can contribute to pilot error.

The glide slope at Guam airport was out of service, but this was not a big problem as there had been many safe landings before. However, the weather was a bit challenging that night, with some little cells near the airport. The captain decided to do a VOR/DME approach, which requires coordination to set up and come down in steps, but then switched to a visual approach when he saw the lights of Guam. The VOR is a beacon pilots use to calculate altitude, and the captain's strategy was to use it to get close to the airport and then land visually.

The captain did not prepare a backup plan for landing in case things went wrong, and didn't coordinate with the co-pilot. The VOR the captain relied on for landing was located 2.5 miles away on Nimitz Hill, not at the airport. Fatigue was likely a factor, as it was a back-of-the-clock flight and the captain had been up since 6 a.m. the previous day. These factors, combined with bad weather and a minor technical malfunction, created preconditions for a plane crash that required the combined efforts of everyone in the cockpit.

The flight recorder transcript of the final thirty minutes of Korean Air Flight 801 reveals the captain's complaints of exhaustion and the first officer's hesitation to speak up, which was expected in the airline's culture of the captain being in charge and doing what he wants. This cultural issue was highlighted in a Delta report on Korean Air, where the first officer and flight engineer failed to speak up despite a mistake in Air Traffic Control.

The culture in Korean Air cockpit includes a strict hierarchy and formal language based on social standing. The first officer would have addressed the captain with formal deference, and any action or conversation would be conducted in order of seniority. The first officer's hesitation to speak up during the mistake in Air Traffic Control highlights the cultural issue in which the captain is in charge and does what he wants. The Korean language has six different levels of conversational address depending on the relationship between the addressee and the addresser.

The text describes a scenario where the flight crew is approaching an airport in bad weather conditions. The captain has committed to a visual approach, but the first officer and flight engineer have concerns about the weather and lack of backup plan. The flight engineer hints at the weather radar's indications, but only once, which is considered unusual in Western communication that prioritizes clear and unambiguous communication. The crew briefly sees lights in the distance, but it's an illusion, and there's still a significant amount of bad weather ahead. The first officer and flight engineer are trying to convey their concerns without directly challenging the captain's authority.

The text highlights the differences in communication styles between Western and Asian cultures. While Western communication is transmitter-oriented, Asian cultures, including Korea, are receiver-oriented. The latter emphasizes the listener's responsibility to understand the speaker's implied meanings. The article provides an example of a Korean conversation that requires subtle interpretation. However, this style of communication is not effective in situations that require quick, unambiguous communication, such as a cockpit during a storm. Korean Air hired an outsider to address their communication problems, including evaluating the English language skills of their flight crews.

Greenberg, former CEO of Korean Air, implemented a program to improve the aviation English proficiency of pilots. He brought in Boeing subsidiary Alteon to conduct training in English, and made it a requirement for pilots to be fluent in the language. Greenberg believed English was essential for communication in the aviation world and allowed pilots to adopt an alternate identity outside of their cultural roles in the cockpit. No one was fired for proficiency shortcomings, but language proficiency served as a filter for pilot retention.

Greenberg's reform at Korean Air allowed pilots to participate in a culture and language with a different legacy, freeing them from the constraints of Korean hierarchy. He didn't assume cultural legacies were indelible, but believed change was possible if pilots were honest about their heritage and willing to confront aspects that did not suit the aviation world. Greenberg's approach was successful in transforming the work relationship of Korean pilots and was later applied to retrain and promote senior Korean flight engineers at Cargo 360.

The text discusses the importance of acknowledging cultural differences in professional success, specifically in the aviation industry. The example of retraining Eastern pilots for Western cockpits is given as evidence of the liberating potential of cultural adaptation. The text also criticizes the reluctance to discuss cultural differences, citing a correlation between a country's culture and its rate of plane crashes. An anecdote about miscommunication in the cockpit highlights the consequences of ignoring cultural differences.

The text describes a communication breakdown in the cockpit of a plane attempting to land in poor weather conditions. The crew becomes confused when their instruments indicate that the plane is close to the ground, but they cannot see the runway. The first officer eventually suggests aborting the landing, but it is too late to avoid a crash. The text highlights the difficulties of implementing training in real-life situations and the consequences of ineffective communication in high-pressure situations.

The text starts with a recording of a plane crash, followed by a chapter titled "Rice Paddies and Math Tests." The chapter describes the rapidly changing landscape of the Pearl River Delta in Southern China, where factories and apartment buildings now stand where rice paddies once were. However, further away from the industrial heartland lies Guangzhou and the beautiful countryside, where traditional mud-brick huts and open-air markets can be found. The area is also abundant with rice paddies.

The text discusses the intricate process of rice cultivation in China, where rice paddies are carved into mountainsides or constructed from marshland and river plains. A complex system of dikes and channels must be built to irrigate the fields and carefully engineered clay floors must be created to properly drain the rice while keeping it submerged at the optimum level. Traditional fertilization methods, including the use of night soil and burned compost, are also discussed.

Rice farming in South China involved planting and nurturing multiple varieties of rice to manage the risk of crop failure. Farmers meticulously tended to the rice crops, checking water levels and weeding by hand. Rice was the staple food, sold at the market to buy other necessities, and a measure of wealth and status. Without rice, survival was difficult, making it an essential aspect of life in South China.

Chinese speakers have a higher chance of remembering a list of numbers because their language allows them to say all seven numbers within the two-second memory loop. Chinese number words are brief, taking less than one-quarter of a second to utter, while their English equivalents are longer. The difference in length of number words affects the memory span of language speakers. Cantonese dialect of Chinese has the highest efficacy with a memory span of about 10 digits. There is a difference in how number-naming systems in Western and Asian languages are constructed. In English, the numbering system is inconsistent with words like fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen, instead of oneteen, twoteen, threeteen, and fiveteen.

The number system in English is irregular, while in China, Japan, and Korea it is logical and based on the decade and unit numbers. This results in Asian children learning to count faster and perform basic math functions more easily. By the age of four, Chinese children can count up to forty while American children can only count up to fifteen. This fundamental difference in the counting system affects the attitude towards math.

Asian children have an advantage in math due to the logical structure of their counting and fraction systems in their languages. This advantage leads to a greater likelihood of enjoying math, trying harder, and taking more math classes. However, this advantage is often mistakenly attributed to an innate Asian proclivity for math, which is a problematic assumption.

Being good at math may not only be a function of intelligence, but also cultural legacy. The differences in number systems between East and West suggest that cultural legacies can impact intellectual tasks. For example, the demands of growing rice may make someone better at math. Rice farming is historically done on small plots of land in Asia, which required a different approach than the large-scale, mechanized agriculture of the West. Cultural legacies matter and may have surprising effects on twenty-first-century tasks.

Rice farmers in Asia historically improved yields through skill and hard work, rather than mechanization. They became better managers of time, water, and land, and utilized every square inch of their rice paddies. Rice agriculture is skill-oriented, and rice farmers historically worked harder than other farmers. In contrast, many pre-modern hunter-gatherer societies had a leisurely life and worked only a few hours a week.

Throughout history, many people worked only a few hours a day for a few months each year, with long periods of idleness in between. Peasants in eighteenth-century Europe, for example, worked for about 1,200 hours annually, and some villages essentially hibernated during the winter to conserve resources. This pattern of work and leisure was a physical and economic necessity to prevent hunger and conserve supplies.

In contrast to the leisurely lifestyles of some historical European peasants, rice farmers in Southern China worked intensely for 3,000 hours per year, including during the dry season, and engaged in a variety of tasks. Although the work was physically demanding, it was also meaningful and complex, with a clear relationship between effort and reward.

Wet-rice farming in China and Japan never developed oppressive feudal systems due to the complexity and exactness of the farming process. Landlords collected a fixed rent and allowed farmers autonomy in their work. The labor-intensive nature of rice farming requires care and precision in planting, irrigation, and harvesting, necessitating a system of incentives for laborers to ensure a successful harvest.

The success of rice cultivation in China is attributed to hard work and self-reliance, as reflected in Chinese peasant proverbs. In contrast, Russian peasant proverbs reflect fatalism and pessimism. Rice cultivation is not suitable for slavery or wage labor due to the need for careful irrigation control. Peasants must work hard to ensure a successful harvest and provide for their families.

The culture of hard work and dedication among Asians is often stereotyped but should be celebrated. Many successful people have worked harder than their peers to achieve their goals. The rice paddy culture of finding meaning in hard work has been particularly useful in mathematics. A video of a woman trying to solve a math problem demonstrates the significance of algebra without requiring specific knowledge of the subject.

Math professor Alan Schoenfeld created a computer program to teach students about calculating the slope of a line. The program asks users to enter coordinates to draw a line. Renee, a nurse, became hooked on the program and tried to draw a line parallel to the y axis, unaware that it was an impossible task. Schoenfeld considers her "glorious misconception" a perfect example of how misconceptions can be resolved.

Renee tries to make a straight line parallel to the y axis, but she misunderstands that increasing the y axis coordinate will make the line steeper instead of vertical. She tries different approaches and types in higher numbers until she realizes that the line will never reach the y axis, but still doesn't fully understand the concept. Schoenfeld gently guides her in the right direction, and she starts to make progress by recognizing the relationship between the y axis coordinate and the slope of the line.

Renee struggles to understand how to draw a vertical line parallel to the y axis, but eventually realizes that a vertical line is anything divided by zero, which is an undefined number. Despite her difficulties, Renee persists in experimenting and thinking out loud until she fully understands the concept. This perseverance is what the author sees as the key to learning mathematics, as illustrated by Renee's 22-minute struggle to solve an eighth-grade math problem.

The article discusses the importance of persistence and willingness to make sense of problems in mathematics, highlighting the example of a student named Renee who impressed her teacher with her attitude towards problem-solving. The teacher teaches a course on problem-solving and emphasizes the need to unlearn mathematical habits and work hard to make progress. The article argues that success in mathematics is more a function of attitude than innate ability.

The article discusses the importance of cultural attitudes towards mathematics and problem-solving, and suggests that a cultural emphasis on persistence and exploration could lead to greater success in mathematics. The article cites the TIMSS test, which includes a questionnaire that correlates with a country's success in math, suggesting that students who are willing to concentrate and focus on the questionnaire tend to do well on the math portion of the test.

Educational researcher Erling Boe discovered that the ability to finish a questionnaire and excel in a math test are the same, meaning a culture's emphasis on effort and hard work can predict their math performance. Cultures shaped by wet-rice agriculture and meaningful work such as Singapore, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Japan are at the top of both lists. The KIPP Academy, an experimental public school, opened in the mid-1990s.

KIPP Academy is a middle school located in the South Bronx, one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City. It has large classes and no entrance exams, with students chosen by lottery. Despite the challenging circumstances, the school has a unique culture of discipline and high expectations, with students taught to follow a protocol called SSLANT and the walls decorated with pennants from colleges KIPP graduates have attended. KIPP has become one of the most desirable public schools in the area.

KIPP is a network of schools across the US known for their success in mathematics education, particularly among lower-income students in disadvantaged areas. By taking cultural legacies seriously, KIPP has become one of the most promising new educational philosophies in the US. In the early 19th century, public education in the US was a haphazard collection of locally-run schoolhouses, but reformers established a system of public education.

In the early days of public education in the US, reformers sought to ensure that all children received a basic education, but they were also concerned about overtaxing students. Early educational reformers believed that too much schooling could lead to mental health problems and could be detrimental to students' health and natural abilities. Consequently, reformers sought to reduce study time by eliminating Saturday classes, shortening the school day, and lengthening vacations, as long periods of rest were seen as necessary for protecting the mind from injury.

The article discusses the different views of rest and study between Western and Asian cultures, highlighting the influence of agricultural rhythms on education. While Western education advocates for balancing effort with rest and promotes summer vacation as a way to avoid mental exhaustion, Asian cultures prioritize constant study and work due to their agricultural practices. The summer vacation is a unique American tradition that has had a significant impact on the learning patterns of students today.

Research led by Karl Alexander from Johns Hopkins University tracked the progress of 650 first graders in the Baltimore public school system and found that the achievement gap between students from low and high socioeconomic backgrounds more than doubled in five years. This phenomenon challenges the belief that disadvantaged students have lower inherent ability or that schools are failing them. The study shows the importance of addressing summer learning loss, which disproportionately affects low-income students, in closing the achievement gap.

The California Achievement Test was given in both June and September, allowing for analysis of how much students learned over the school year and summer. Results showed that lower-income students out-learned wealthy students over five years of elementary school, and only lagged behind middle-class students by a modest amount. In second grade, lower-income students actually learned more than middle- or upper-class students.

Wealthy students gain reading skills over summer vacation while poor students fall behind, leading to a large achievement gap. The advantage that wealthy students have over poor students is largely due to differences in parenting styles, such as concerted cultivation, that lead to engagement in educational activities during the summer.

The text argues that the traditional approach to education in the United States, which focuses on reducing class sizes and rewriting curricula, overlooks the importance of increasing the amount of time children spend learning. Studies suggest that children from wealthier families often perform better academically because they have access to more educational opportunities during the summer months. By contrast, poorer children often lack access to these opportunities, which puts them at a disadvantage. Research indicates that year-round schooling could help to close this gap and improve academic performance.

The length of the school year in the United States is shorter than in many other countries, which may contribute to lower academic achievement. KIPP schools seek to address this issue by providing students with a longer school day and year-round instruction. At KIPP, students attend school from 7:25 am to 5 pm, with additional after-school programs available. This results in 50-60% more learning time than traditional public schools. By increasing the amount of time students spend in the classroom, KIPP hopes to close the achievement gap and provide students with the tools they need to succeed.

The KIPP Academy has lower-income students who come in on Saturdays and have a longer school year to combat summer learning loss. They prioritize grit, self-control, motivation, incentives, rewards, and discipline. The classrooms emphasize participation and problem-solving, and students are given extra time to learn concepts.

Extended class time in math education allows for a slower pace, more time for review and understanding, and meaningful connections between effort and reward. The extra time and relaxed atmosphere have led to high success rates, as evidenced by certificates from the New York State Regents exam. KIPP's success is less glamorous than the miracle school story, but their methods have proven effective.

The article describes a typical day in the life of a KIPP student named Marita, who wakes up at 5:45 am and commutes to school with friends. KIPP students often have long commutes and wake up very early. Marita's mother signed her up for KIPP, which changed her life, and she leaves school at 5 pm to return home.

Marita, a KIPP student, spends two to three hours on homework each night and often works until 9 or 10 pm, sometimes skipping dinner. She shares a room with her mother and wakes up at 5:45 am for a long commute to school. Marita is very close to her mother, but their living situation is unusual for a child. Marita sometimes stays up late and dozes off in class, but still tries to get information.

Marita's life as a twelve-year-old is not typical, as she has responsibilities and lacks the resources provided by her community. To succeed, she has had to shed part of her cultural identity and replace it with the KIPP program, sacrificing her free time and social life. Her former friend is discouraged by the workload and perceives Marita as smart, but Marita insists that everyone is smart and the workload is necessary for success.

Marita has made a bargain with her school: she sacrifices her free time and social life to attend KIPP in exchange for an opportunity to escape poverty. KIPP promises to provide her with a chance to succeed academically, leading to scholarships and college acceptances for most students. Outliers' message is that success is not solely based on personal decisions or intelligence, but also on opportunities that are seized. For Marita, KIPP provides a valuable opportunity for success.

The text argues that success is often attributed to individual merit, but it is largely determined by opportunities provided by society. The author gives examples of how arbitrary advantages, such as birth dates, can have a significant impact on success. Providing opportunities for all can lead to a richer and more diverse society. The story of Marita, a student in the South Bronx, illustrates how meaningful work can transform lives. The text ends with a quote from a Jamaican document on emancipation.

The text tells the story of twin sisters, Faith and Joyce, born to schoolteachers in a small village in Jamaica in 1931. The girls grew up in a small cottage on the grounds of the local Anglican church, where their father taught in a one-room schoolhouse. Their parents valued education and instilled a love of learning in their daughters. At age eleven, the girls won scholarships to attend a boarding school called Saint Hildas.

The author's mother, Joyce Gladwell, was accepted to University College in London and later fell in love with and married a math professor named Graham. They moved to Canada, had three sons, and built a beautiful home. However, the story of her path to success leaves out her many opportunities and cultural legacy, including a visit by a historian concerned with Jamaica's educational system. The story is not a lie, but it is false in the sense that it leaves out important details.

Jamaica's educational system provided limited opportunities, with few scholarships and private schooling being prohibitively expensive. A historian named William M. MacMillan visited Jamaica and criticized England's treatment of its colonies, particularly the narrow and insecure bridge between primary and high school. He warned that the government must provide opportunities or there would be trouble. A year later, a wave of riots and unrest swept the Caribbean, prompting the British government to implement reforms, including all-island scholarships for academically minded students. The author's mother and twin sister received scholarships and a high school education, which they may not have received had they been born earlier.

The writer's grandmother was a strong force in shaping her daughters' education, pushing them to attend a good school and receive tutoring in Latin and algebra. Her mother and aunt were able to attend the school through scholarships, but initially only the aunt received one. However, the grandmother sent both daughters and prayed for a solution, which came when another girl at the school won two scholarships, allowing the second scholarship to go to the writer's mother.

The writer's academic twin aunt won a Centenary Scholarship which covered the costs of her education, but the writer's mother was not as fortunate and had to find a way to pay for her education in England. There were no student loan programs or credit lines available, so her mother borrowed money from a Chinese shopkeeper in the neighboring town. The amount borrowed was likely significant, but the shopkeeper lent it to her because she was a respected teacher who paid her bills promptly.

Daisy Nation was a beloved figure who helped Joyce Gladwell achieve her college education. Daisy was from Jamaica and was the descendant of a white coffee plantation owner who had a public relationship with a black slave woman, which was socially acceptable in Jamaica but not in the American South. The Caribbean during that period was predominantly a slave colony.

In the West Indies, most white men had black or brown mistresses, and mulattoes were seen as potential allies and moved up the social and economic ladder. Mulatto mistresses were often left substantial fortunes in wills, and a law was passed capping bequests. Europeans settling in the West Indies often had mistresses who were purchased and their progeny were emancipated and sent to England for education. Daisy's grandfather, John, was a free man with every benefit of education, born one generation removed from a slave ship in an African penal colony.



Mulatto people in Jamaica, who were of mixed European and Arawak descent, achieved full civil liberties, including voting, at the same time as Jews in 1826. 

They had high status and could do anything a white person could do within the context of a still-slave society, and many became skilled artisans in the agro-industrial sugar mills. 

Jamaica's English elite had little interest in nation building and left the task to the coloreds, who came to dominate the professional classes and held positions such as the mayor of Kingston and founder of the Daily Gleaner newspaper. 

The white population was less involved in building a new society.



Colored people in Jamaica, who were the cultural elite, ran schools and became doctors and lawyers, while also holding positions such as the bishop of Kingston. 

In the early 1950s, white and light-skinned people made up the majority of lawyers and members of parliament in Jamaica, despite being a minority in the population. 

The advantage of having even a little bit of whiteness in ancestry gave the colored minority access to meaningful work and occupational success two or three generations later. 

Daisy Ford's ambition for her daughters was part of a legacy of privilege inherited from her family members who were teachers and successful business owners.

The author's ancestors were an educated and successful African American family. However, their success was built upon the morally complicated act of William Ford purchasing the author's great-great-great-grandmother as a slave. Slavery in Jamaica involved brutal exploitation of human property, with plantation owners cherishing their own children born from slaves while simultaneously treating slaves as property. Thomas Thistlewood, a plantation owner, had a relationship with a slave named Phibbah whom he adored, but he was also a monster who brutally punished runaway slaves.

Colorism was rampant in Jamaica, with lighter skin being fetishized and giving people a social advantage. Even within families, darker members were discriminated against in favor of lighter-skinned relatives, with fair children being seen as raising the family's status. The author's family was not immune to this prejudice, with Daisy being proud of her lighter-skinned husband but also being criticized for her own dark skin. One of the author's relatives was white and married to a dark-skinned man, and after her husband's death, she faced discrimination while traveling to visit her dark-skinned daughters.

The text describes two incidents of racial discrimination faced by the author's family, including her mother's disownment of her dark-skinned daughter and a landlord's refusal to rent to a Jamaican family. The author's mother wrote a book about her experiences, which included her struggle to reconcile her experience with her faith and her acknowledgement of her own past prejudices.

The text discusses the difficulty of acknowledging one's advantages and inheritances that contribute to success, and the importance of humility in recognizing the role of community, opportunity, and luck. The author gives examples of successful individuals, including lawyers, mathematicians, and entrepreneurs, whose achievements are the result of various advantages and inheritances. The author also reflects on their own family history, which includes the legacy of slavery and the privilege gained from it.

The text discusses the influence of history and culture on individual success and the unfair advantages some people have over others. It uses examples from the author's family history and from the town of Roseto to illustrate these points. It also mentions Jeb Bush's belief in the "self-made man" myth and his pride in his financial success.

The text discusses the relative-age effect in sports, which refers to the advantage that older players have over younger players due to the way age cutoffs are determined. The author cites research by Roger Barnsley and others and mentions examples from hockey, football, and baseball. The text also discusses self-fulfilling prophecies and the history of the term.

 Joyce Gladwell's book, Brown Face, Big Master, details her experiences as a black woman in the UK. 

 The book, Outliers, was a collective effort and inspired by the work of Richard Nisbett's book, Culture of Honor.

The author expresses gratitude towards several individuals who provided support and assistance throughout the writing and publishing of his book, "Outliers". This includes friends who provided feedback on the manuscript, research and fact-checking assistants, his editor, agent, and family.

The author reflects on the lessons he learned about the meaning of work from his father and the importance of clear communication from his mother. He also provides background information on himself and his career, including his work as a staff writer for The New Yorker and the topics he explores in his writing. Finally, he discusses the concept of outliers and his interest in studying individuals who fall outside of normal experience.

The author, Malcolm Gladwell, wrote the book "Outliers" out of frustration with our crude understanding of success, as our current explanations focus too much on individual traits rather than broader societal and cultural factors. Gladwell was inspired to write the book by returning to the same themes that fascinate him, such as epidemics and instantaneous judgments of others.

In "Outliers," Gladwell argues that to understand success, one must look beyond individual traits and examine cultural, societal, and generational factors. He gives examples, such as successful Jewish lawyers born to immigrant parents in the garment industry, and a disproportionate number of professional hockey players born in the first few months of the year. While individuals still play a role in success, Gladwell believes we underestimate the impact of external factors.

The author suggests that certain years and cultures can lead to success and outliers in software entrepreneurship and wealth. The book "Outliers" reveals surprising patterns in the lives of successful people, including the connection between culture and plane crashes. Acknowledging this connection has led to some unsafe airlines improving their safety. The author's interest in extreme circumstances stems from the belief that disasters teach us more about human behavior than ordinary life. "Outliers" differs from the author's previous works in its focus on people and their stories.

The book "Outliers" tells the stories of successful people in a different way than usual, focusing on their early lives and the cultural factors that led to their success. The author had many memorable experiences while researching the book, including meeting Chris Langan, deciphering black box recorders with crash investigators, and visiting places like a town in eastern Pennsylvania where no one has heart attacks. Like the author's previous works, "Outliers" aims to make readers think about the world differently and understand the power of factors like culture and intuition.

Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers" challenges the notion of self-made success and emphasizes the role of circumstances and support networks in achieving great accomplishments. The last chapter is a personal reflection on his grandmother's influence on his family's success. Discussion topics include the concept of cultural language, the parallels between ecological systems and accumulative advantage, and individual beliefs about success.

Malcolm Gladwell challenges traditional beliefs about innate talent and emphasizes the role of preparation and opportunity in success. He discusses the limitations of focusing on personal achievement and the need to redefine success in a more inclusive way. The 10,000-hour rule and the impact of advantages on social mobility are also addressed. Gladwell uses the example of Canadian hockey selection as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Readers are prompted to consider the outliers in their own lives and whether reading the book has altered their perspectives.

The text explores the impact of relative age on various social phenomena. It discusses how prophecy perpetuates a reign of error, and how basketball accessibility and ubiquity relate to age. It also looks at the correlation between birth date and athletic success, as well as the advantage of being born in the 1830s for business success. Lastly, it mentions the creation of the super IQ test by Ronald K. Hoeflin.

The text discusses Chris Langan, who has an IQ in the 200 range, and describes a similar child named L from a study on exceptionally gifted children. It highlights L's erudition, passion for accuracy, and impressive abilities. The text also poses a riddle about manhole covers and explains why round covers cannot fall into the manhole.

The article discusses the importance of IQ in determining success in education and career, with specific threshold regions identified. While high IQ is still valued, personality and character traits are also important. Elite Ivy League schools may not produce significantly more Nobel Prize winners despite their resources and prestige. The selection process for these schools is considered absurd.

The article highlights the high number of qualified applicants to Harvard University and the low acceptance rate, suggesting a lottery system could be fairer. It also mentions a student's creative answers to a question on the uses of a brick. The heritability of IQ is estimated at around 50%, and a scene from a novel is used to illustrate the antipathy towards takeover law.

The text discusses the rise of Jewish lawyers in the field of takeover law due to the unwillingness of WASP firms to enter the field. The author acknowledges the role of luck but emphasizes the hard work and efforts made by these lawyers. The author also shares a personal connection to the topic through his literary agency founded by a Jewish lawyer. The text also acknowledges the tragic history of Jewish immigrants and the Holocaust.

The text discusses the harsh working conditions in the garment industry in the past, with workers often working long hours. Despite this, the children of garment workers were able to climb the professional ladder due to their practical intelligence and savvy gained from watching their parents. The idea that cultural legacies have a lasting impact is also explored through David Hackett Fischer's book "Albion's Seed."

In his book, David Hackett Fischer argues that the United States can be divided into four distinct regions based on the cultures of their original settlers, which still characterize those regions today. Studies show that Southerners are more likely to explode in anger than Northerners when provoked, and this behavior is passed down through social heritance, similar to the persistence of regional accents. The original settlers of Appalachia had a distinct dialect and vocabulary.

Studies show that speech patterns and behaviors are likely passed down through social heritance. Industrial accidents, including plane crashes and nuclear meltdowns, often begin as routine incidents but escalate due to a chain of errors and failures in backup systems, as illustrated by the Three Mile Island incident.
