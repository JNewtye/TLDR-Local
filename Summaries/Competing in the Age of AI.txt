The book discusses how artificial intelligence is transforming firms and the economy, changing the fundamental nature of companies, and describes the core of the new firm as an AI factory.

The book "Competing in the Age of AI" discusses the transformation of firms and the economy through artificial intelligence, and covers topics such as the core of the new firm as an AI factory, the need for a fundamentally different operating architecture, and the ethical challenges generated by the transformation of the nature of firms. The age of AI is changing the rules of the game, and presents new challenges for leaders of digital firms, traditional organizations, startups, regulatory institutions, and communities. The book also includes a story of a painting that was created using AI as a promotion for a Dutch bank.

Scientists and Rembrandt experts used learning algorithms to create a new painting that closely imitated Rembrandt's style. This project, called The Next Rembrandt, demonstrates how AI is expanding the range of artistic possibilities. Google's Arts and Machine Intelligence program is connecting artists and engineers to explore how creative practices are being transformed, with AI being used to create completely new works of art. The Art & Artificial Intelligence Lab at Rutgers University is working on an algorithm called AICAN that produces paintings inspired by established artistic styles but entirely new.

AI algorithms expand the range of artistic creation and distribution methods while also modeling the course of art history. AI is becoming the new operational foundation of businesses and is transforming the very nature of organizations, changing how they operate and compete. This book describes the profound implications of artificial intelligence for business, as it is becoming the universal engine of execution that shapes the execution of all processes.

The use of digital, AI-driven processes in operational systems is transforming the nature of firms, enabling digital scale, scope, and learning, and erasing deep-seated limits that have constrained firm growth and impact for hundreds of years. Even relatively basic artificial intelligence can transform how firms operate without the need for a perfect human replica.

The emergence of digital operating models and AI is transforming competition and changing how industries function, creating new opportunities and challenges. This new age of AI requires a new understanding of strategy and leadership, and is different from previous technological disruptions in that it is transforming the economy as a whole rather than just specific industries. The invention of digital photography is given as an example of how digital technologies can disrupt and transform an entire industry.

The digitization of photography disrupted traditional players and created new business opportunities. Digital representation transformed the nature of activities connected to photography, leading to an increase in sharing photos and the rise of companies such as Facebook, Tencent, Snapchat, Line, and TikTok. AI is expanding the impact of photography's transformation through analyzing the vast number of photos being taken every day, powering the improvement of algorithms for facial recognition, photo sorting, and image enhancement. Social platforms can automatically identify and predict not only family and friends but also affinities and backgrounds. Photo apps are already recommending products, services, and news feeds that users might like.

Digitizing an activity, such as photography, enables the emergence of new companies with a different operating model that can compete in different ways. Digitization transforms an activity by making it infinitely scalable, easily connectable, and able to embed processing instructions, which can continuously train and improve algorithms. This transforms the ways a firm can and should operate, leading to the emergence of firms designed to release the full potential of digital networks, data, algorithms, and AI.

Digitization can greatly enhance a firm's potential for scale, scope, and learning, but it can also overwhelm traditional companies. Digital operating models create value differently and require a different way of competing. However, the rise of AI-driven firms poses new challenges and risks, such as privacy, cybersecurity, bias, and fake news.

Digital firms like Amazon can transform traditional industries by leveraging their digital operating model to scale, extend their scope, and learn. They collide with traditional businesses and change the rules of competition. However, the advantages of scale tend to be limited by the complexity of the operating model, which can increase costs and decrease service levels. The new breed of digital firms requires new approaches to leadership, regulation, and ethics.

Amazon's digital systems, which embrace the advantages of digital scale, scope, and learning, allow for a more scalable and capable enterprise capable of delivering an unprecedented scope of products and services with pinpoint targeting. Digitized processes and tasks deliver customer value, and as more data is ingested, the system becomes better and better. AI engines like Amazon's collaborative filtering algorithms do not suffer from traditional recruitment and training process limitations and continually improve with data and scale.

Amazon's operating model centers on digitizing operational excellence through the application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced robotics, minimizing managerial complexity and maximizing digital scalability. People are secondary in critical workflows, and computers define what humans should do. Amazon's service improves with volume, whereas traditional businesses run into complexity costs. As Amazon grows, the industry is transformed, and the traditional business loses out.

Amazon's Echo uses Alexa, a voice interface to the company's AI platform, which has the potential to connect the user to a limitless array of services and products. As Echo improves over time, it transforms traditional tasks and continues to increase its functionality. With over 50,000 skills developed by third-party developers, Amazon's model is scaling well and changing the way people shop. Amazon has become a driver of industry transformation, impacting and raising expectations of personalization across the array of consumer products and services.

Amazon's capitalization continues to soar, but it faces increasing scrutiny from regulators and competitors are not standing still. The impact of Amazon on retail has been keenly felt, with traditional firms struggling to compete with Amazon's convenience, low prices, and logistics infrastructure. Walmart is rearchitecting its operating model on a digital and AI-enabled foundation to confront Amazon's challenge. This includes replacing traditional siloed enterprise software systems with an integrated, cloud-based architecture to enhance or automate operating tasks.

Walmart has been investing in digital capabilities such as data analytics and AI to drive growth and transformation. It has acquired digital firms and partnered with Microsoft to access cloud capacity, technology, and AI capabilities. To sustain its growth and compete with Amazon, Walmart needs to transform its in-store experience and bring online experiences to its physical stores. Walmart is experimenting with advanced technologies such as cameras, sensors, computer vision, and deep learning software to acquire the convenience of online shopping in stores.

Walmart and other retailers are experimenting with advanced technologies such as cameras, sensors, and real-time data from personal devices to improve the in-store experience and personalize it for customers. Aggregate customer data can create heat maps to reveal areas that need improvement, and real-time information can help sales reps recommend items and engage with customers. Amazon Go stores have no cashiers and no lines, and customers scan their app upon entry and exit to track their movements and purchases. Retailers can access real estate without the bottleneck of hiring, training, and managing employees with the help of sophisticated, digitally-enabled supply chains.

The digital age has impacted businesses, professions, and applications, and Tencent, the maker of WeChat, has played a major role in this shift. With app-based digital systems being the preferred mode of payment in Asia, companies like JD.com have leveraged a digital operating model to scale their operations with virtually no managerial cost. Furthermore, the availability of digital payments has allowed street performers and beggars to enter the digital age. The resulting data, analytics, and AI have driven a wave of new applications, with WeChat Pay even being requested at 7-Eleven in luxury malls.

Tencent, the maker of WeChat, built its success by creating a mobile messaging application with a range of functionalities and an open platform for software developers to plug in external services. Tencent's digital operating model is driven by a data platform enabling analytics and AI opportunities with data on social interactions, spending patterns, search trends, and political sentiment. This data is used to automate and expand a variety of services, and Tencent is leveraging its connections with large masses of consumers to transform industries from financial services to healthcare.

Tencent and Ant Financial have a larger consumer base than the biggest banks in the US and Europe and offer a wide range of continuously improving products, making them valuable companies and important players in the global economy. Their increasing influence is drawing attention from regulators and communities. AI-driven processes and digital networks challenge traditional assumptions about work, firms, and institutions, rendering skills and talents obsolete and replacing traditional activities.

The broad deployment of AI and digital networks is transforming social and political interaction, threatening jobs and creating vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. This transformation affects every organization and sector of the economy, requiring a new approach to create, capture, and deliver value. This book provides guidance for leaders of digital and traditional organizations to understand and leverage the potential of this new age, while transforming operating capabilities to support new strategies.

Several firms are investing in AI and changing the way they operate, leading to new opportunities for startups, established firms, and even artists. AI-driven transformation prompts the creation of new companies and motivates old companies to lead again. The book aims to provide leaders of organizations with a set of frameworks for understanding, competing, and operating in the age of AI. The authors have led a broad portfolio of research projects at Harvard Business School to understand digital transformation, networks, and the impact of AI across companies.

The authors have engaged with a wide range of organizations and participants to distill what they have learned into this book. The book targets managers in existing firms and entrepreneurs and addresses a new observation of a new breed of firm characterized by digital scale, scope, and learning, transforming the economy. The transformation involves rearchitecting how the firm works and changing the way it gathers and uses data, reacts to information, makes operating decisions, and executes operating tasks. The work stands on foundations built by others.

The book describes the emergence of a new kind of firm driven by digital networks and AI, which is defining a new economic age. It focuses on the implications of AI for strategy and leadership and is divided into ten chapters. The second chapter examines the new concept of the firm by studying three digital unicorns, and the third chapter homes in on the core of the new firm using Netflix as an example.

 The text highlights the need for both legacy and new companies to embrace and invest in understanding, deploying, and managing new strategies and capabilities to lead to sustainable growth and opportunity. 

 The focus is on shaping the AI trend, rather than opposing it. 

 The success of Ant Financial, the largest fintech firm, is attributed to its ability to leverage data to learn about user needs and respond with digital services. 

 Ant Financial's adoption of its services across China and beyond provides vast amounts of data that informs decision making. 

 The key to Ant Financial's success is rethinking the way firms create, capture, and deliver value.

Ant Financial is using AI and digital technologies to transform financial services, with an efficient operating model and a broad scope of services, serving over 700 million customers with fewer than 10,000 employees. The chapter explores Ant Financial, Ocado, and Peloton as examples of new digital firms disrupting traditional industries with software, data, and AI. Google is also highlighted for placing AI at the core of its business. The companies are redefining how firms operate, transforming the economy, and creating new business models. The chapter analyzes the traditional and new operating models, and how they shape and execute value propositions.

Firms are necessary to coordinate tasks with lower transaction costs, using long-term contracts. The value of a firm is shaped by its business model and operating model, with the former defining how it creates and captures value, and the latter enabling the delivery of goods and services. The business model encompasses the company's strategy, while the operating model encompasses the systems, processes, and capabilities that deliver value. Value creation involves creating value for the customer and deploying a method to capture some of that value.

Value creation for customers involves solving their problems, also known as the value proposition. Companies create value by delivering quality, styling, comfort, ride quality, cost, and brand. Factors in value creation can change based on the customer's preferences. A company's approach to value creation requires choosing the precise problem it is solving for the customer and its positioning in the marketplace. Ride-sharing value creation relies on the availability of drivers, wait time, trust in policies, customer ratings, ease of use, and cost. The approach to value creation varies based on the company's focus and ecosystem.

Value capture for companies should be less than the value created for the customer. The value capture for an auto company rests primarily on the fact that the sales price of the car is greater than the cost of manufacturing the car. The value capture story for a ride-sharing company relies on a customer's choosing to use the ride-sharing service time after time. In digital firms, value creation and capture can be separated more easily, and often come from different stakeholders.

The success of a business model depends on an effective operating model which delivers value to customers. While the business model creates goals for value creation and capture, the operating model is the plan to achieve those goals. The operating model is complex and includes people, technology, and capital investments. Its overarching objectives are to deliver value at scale, achieve scope, and engage in learning. Executives face three operating challenges of managing scale, achieving scope, and learning to improve and innovate.

Firms are structured to efficiently produce and deliver goods and services of increasing complexity and scope, which individuals cannot achieve alone. Economies of scale and scope are important for establishing multiple lines of business and efficiently delivering a variety of goods and services. Learning is essential for driving continuous improvement, increasing operating performance over time, and developing new products and services, which modern corporations rely on to remain viable and competitive.

The alignment between a firm's business model and operating model is crucial for optimizing performance. By driving scale, scope, and learning objectives in alignment with their business models, firms can achieve superior performance. However, expanding each of the three operational dimensions increases complexity and traditional operating models become more challenging to manage. Digital firms are reaching new levels of scalability, achieving a broader scope, and learning and adapting faster by deploying a fundamentally new operating model that transforms the critical path in the delivery of value through software and data-driven algorithms.

Ant Financial, a payment platform created by Alibaba, has built an escrow-based financial payment service to facilitate transactions between merchants and buyers, creating a substitute for trust. Value creation is related to this substitute, and value capture occurs through the 0.6%.

Alipay, a digital payment platform in China, charges a transaction fee to merchants and aims to increase both the intensive and extensive margins of transactions to increase its user base. As the number of buyers and sellers on the platform increases, the value of Alipay increases through a positive feedback loop. Alipay's growth has been exponential since its launch beyond Alibaba's shopping platform in 2004, and by 2011 it allowed customers to make purchases via their mobile phones using QR codes. Alipay takes a 0.6 percent cut of each transaction.

Alipay is a digital payment app in China that allows users to make a wide range of transactions, including buying coffee, hailing cabs, paying bills, and making donations, as long as the vendor has an Alipay account. It was spun off by Alibaba CEO Jack Ma to avoid possible government regulation and became the first product in the portfolio of Ant Financial, which aims to facilitate

Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Alibaba, launched Yue Bao, a money market fund with no minimum deposit required, which attracted over a million users within days and became the largest money market fund in the world with over 500 billion yuan ($81 billion) in nine months. Ant Financial extended its services to include personal investment, wealth management, social credit scoring, internet banking, insurance, education, medical, transportation, social, gaming, dining reservations, and food delivery. By 2019, Ant Financial had over 700 million users and controlled 54% of the mobile payments market in China, dominating the Chinese financial services market even as it faced competition from Tencent.

Ant Financial and Tencent dominate the Chinese mobile payments market, with Ant Financial controlling 54% and Tencent's WeChat controlling 38%. Ant Financial expanded globally with investments and partnerships in mobile payment systems in Asia and acquisitions of biometric authentication technology companies. Ant Financial's business model relies on AI-enabled digital automation and a 3-1-0 system for processing loans, with loan approval and issuance processes being entirely digital and AI-driven.

Ant Financial's MYbank uses data processing and cloud computing technologies to efficiently provide loans to small businesses and individual entrepreneurs in China. The bank's digital systems and integrated data platform allow it to collect and analyze user data to drive functions like personalization and revenue optimization. With these technologies in place, MYbank does not require physical bank locations or a large workforce.

Ant Financial uses data from four main sources, including internal consumer behavior statistics, transaction data from Alibaba, public data, and data from partners to power its algorithmic engine for real-time decision making. Alipay uses algorithms to check for suspicious activity and ensure transaction and player legitimacy, while Zhima credit scores are automatically calculated based on borrower behavior data in real time. The algorithms evolve and improve with each iteration and more data.

Ant Financial, the parent company of Alipay, uses a combination of data analytics and agile innovation to rapidly develop new products and services. It offers perks to customers with good credit and requires additional deposits for those with low credit scores. It also uses an AI-driven fraud prevention monitoring system and a sophisticated experimentation platform to understand the opportunities and risks of new features and products. Ant Financial relies on scenario-based prototyping and innovations in data mining to develop new applications and automate customer issue resolution. The company's impressive learning capabilities and ability to rapidly scale and scope are attributed to its focus on data sources and agile teams.

The digital operating model aims to avoid human intervention in the customer value delivery process by centralizing data and automating data-driven actions. Ant Financial and Amazon are examples of companies that have successfully implemented this model. By removing human and organizational bottlenecks, this model can result in significant benefits.



Digital operating models have low marginal costs, making them easier to scale with little growth constraints. 

Digital technologies enable modular and multi-sided processes that can be easily connected to external networks, adding value and increasing the firm's scope. 

Digitized operating models provide vast amounts of data for faster learning, innovation, and agile product teams. 

The model also reduces the size of the organization and surrounding bureaucracy.



In a software-automated digital organization, traditional operating bottlenecks are removed, transforming the growth process and factors involved in management. 

John Foley's experience at Barnes & Noble led him to transform the traditional stationary bicycle into a digitally transformed fitness product with Peloton. 

Peloton's high-quality indoor bicycle with integrated tablet provides fitness programming and removes constraints of time, space, and capacity.

Peloton's business model has disrupted the fitness industry by offering a digital operating model that brings the fitness studio to customers' homes. Customers pay for equipment and a monthly subscription for unlimited access to fitness programming, including live and recorded workouts in various disciplines. Peloton's value creation is based on convenience, access to great instructors, and a community of fellow members who connect through social media. The business model combines a traditional analog product with digital content, data, analytics, and connectivity.

Peloton has created subcommunities around its celebrity instructors and different training styles, allowing for a communal experience through live classes, leader boards, virtual high-fives, and video connections. The value capture model includes product sales and subscriptions, with a 95% renewal rate for subscriptions. Peloton's operating model focuses on scaling the fitness experience, with live classes having up to 20,000 riders and an expanding library of additional fitness options.

Peloton, known for its sleek fitness equipment, was founded with the idea of designing the iPhone of fitness equipment. The company employs a team of over 70 software engineers and structures itself more like a software company, relying on digital services to deliver the experience to a growing audience of fitness enthusiasts. Peloton's success is attributed to its scalable digital service, which easily expands the scope of the business through digital interfaces. The company raised around $100 million, allowing it to increase capacity, production, and delivery, expand its software and analytics team, and develop its own supply chain.

Peloton has built a sophisticated analytics platform that constantly analyzes data and uses it to improve the user experience, enhancing engagement and reducing customer churn. The company's data stores provide it with a broad range of options to redefine what it means to be a fitness company, and its reliance on software, data, and networks has enabled it to scale fast. Peloton has enjoyed impressive growth, reaching over $700 million in revenue and a $4 billion valuation. Online grocery delivery is one of the most challenging businesses, and it took many years for Ocado to win respect by relying on AI capabilities to deliver perishable items on time to a million people.

UK-based online grocer Ocado has become a success story in the financial markets due to its use of AI and robotics. Its centralized data platform contains unrivaled detail on products, customers, partners, supply chain, and delivery environment, which is accumulated in the cloud and exposed through easy-to-use interfaces for use by agile teams. AI algorithms are in control of Ocado's operational execution, running thousands of routing calculations per second, optimizing truck routing in real-time, and ensuring fresh product delivery.

Ocado's AI technology predicts customer orders and coordinates with organic farmers in its supply chain to schedule refrigerated truck arrivals. Thousands of bots in Ocado's warehouses pick, assemble, and transport groceries, coordinated by algorithms that prioritize crucial and timely deliveries while optimizing efficiency. Human labor is still used for tasks that bots struggle with, but Ocado's technology continues to expand and innovate with increasing scale and flexibility.

Ocado is constantly automating its processes to improve scalability and reliability. It offers its technology platform to third-party retail and delivery services and is expanding globally, with partnerships in Canada and the United States. Its digital capabilities are attracting the attention of Amazon. The company is less transactional and focuses more on using technology to foster consumer loyalty and engagement. Ocado, along with Ant Financial and Peloton, exemplifies the digitization of value delivery, enabling business model innovation and driving industry transformation.

Ant Financial, Ocado, and Peloton each digitized critical processes in their industries, building unique capabilities and employing unique approaches. They transformed their markets through algorithms and networks, with transformative impact. Ant Financial's impressive capabilities in analytics and AI drive scale and scope across financial services, while Ocado uses AI to drive impressive scalability and innovation, and emphasizes the integration of algorithms with human talent. Peloton is driven by networks and community, using data and analytics to enhance engagement and loyalty. Each company shifts human skills and labor into design, production, and enhancement roles while digital technology delivers and sustains the core experience. The operating models of these different firms show similarities in their digitization of critical processes.

The integration of AI at the core of business models removes growth bottlenecks and enables unprecedented scalability. Google's strategic focus has shifted to becoming AI first, with AI as the common foundation across virtually every operating process. Sundar Pichai's announcement showed that AI had moved to the center of the company, to the core of its operating model, and would be the driver of growth for the future.

Google's strategic shift to becoming AI-first signals that AI investments have become essential to the company's business and operating models. AI is now the common foundation across virtually every operating process, with all of Google's products and services leveraging it to increase the value they deliver. An AI-first approach means Google's ads would become increasingly personalized and contextualized, yielding more clicks. This shift to AI-first is a signal for employees, developers, and partners to embed AI to improve their own products and services. The core of the firm, like Google's, is a scalable decision factory, powered by software, data, and algorithms.

The Industrial Revolution led to mass production, but decision making remained traditional until the AI age. The AI factory industrializes data gathering, analytics, and decision making to reinvent the core of the modern firm. Digitized processes are enabled by an AI factory that treats decision making as an industrial process. This enables the superior scale, scope, and learning capacity of the digital firm, which can take various forms of digital operating models.

The AI factory creates a virtuous cycle between user engagement, data collection, algorithm design, prediction, and improvement. It integrates data from multiple sources to refine and train algorithms that make predictions and improve their own accuracy. The predictions then drive decisions and actions, either by informing human insights or by enabling an automated response. Hypotheses are tested through experimentation protocols that enable causal identification of changes that might improve the system. The cycle continually repeats, and the AI factory is at the core of the digital operating model of the modern firm. Examples of prediction cycles in an AI factory include the search engine's autosuggest box and natural search process.

The search engine's search-results page is heavily influenced by data on previous searches, including automated auctions for relevant ads. To improve the search engine's performance, product managers use the experimental machinery to test hypotheses on a statistically relevant sample of users. The AI factory, which uses mass production methods for data processing and analytics, is at the core of a digital operating model. Netflix has transformed the media landscape by using an AI-centric operating model to personalize the user experience, pick movie concepts, and negotiate content agreements.

Netflix recognized the importance of using data to improve the customer experience, starting with developing a recommendation engine. With its streaming service, Netflix could track the full user experience, including behavioral data that helped personalize the user's experience. Netflix also uses AI to automatically queue the next episode or recommend similar movies to increase subscriber viewing time and decrease customer churn rates. The company's customization and personalization have become pervasive, with 33 million different versions of Netflix, each personalized and customized. Netflix also uses data and AI algorithms to decide which content to create on its own.

Netflix uses predictive analytics for audience evaluation and a personalized streaming experience. They have a data pipeline, algorithm development, experimentation platform, and software infrastructure in place to support their AI factory approach. Their success underscores the importance of these components in driving critical operating activities.

The AI factory approach relies on a consistent and componentized software and computing infrastructure to support the data pipeline, algorithms, and experimentation platform. Data is the essential input, and Netflix has been using a broad base of data inputs, including item ratings, stream plays, metadata, and social data for personalization. The data pipeline gathers, inputs, cleans, integrates, processes, and safeguards data in a systematic, sustainable, and scalable way to power the AI factory.

Netflix uses internal and external data sources, including user search terms, connected friend ratings, and external item data features, to make personal recommendations and customize its interface for its estimated 300 million users. The company's vast data is used to create microclusters or taste communities connecting viewers with similar tastes. The datafication of TV entertainment allows Netflix to continuously improve the value it provides to its users.

The datafication of traditional activities has created new value for users in various domains, including home automation with Nest, health tracking with wearables like Oura and Apple Watch, and transportation with ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft. Innovation and technology can transform traditional activities into sources of useful data, and companies may invest in generating new data to extract value.



 Pitney Bowes, a postal equipment provider, is offering data-driven solutions to businesses using its physical address data in the US for marketing and fraud detection. 

 Many companies attempting to build AI factories struggle with fragmented and incomplete data, which is often siloed in incompatible IT systems. 

 Companies need to invest in cleaning and integrating their data to build an effective AI factory, as data is plagued by biases and errors. 

 Data normalization and integration are challenging steps, and a significant investment is required to ensure accuracy and consistency.



 Financial and operational data must be normalized to ensure accuracy and consistency when analyzing integrated datasets. 

 Algorithms, which use data to make decisions, predictions, or solve problems, are the tools that make data useful. 

 Prediction algorithms are increasingly used throughout the economy to predict customer behavior, revenue, and maintenance needs, among other things. 

 Data proliferation and advances in AI algorithms have lowered the cost of making accurate predictions.

AI algorithms can be used for a variety of applications, from simple predictions to complex tasks. Most operational AI systems use one of three approaches to develop accurate predictions using statistical models: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning aims to come as close as possible to a human expert in predicting an outcome by relying on an expert-labeled dataset of the outcome and potential characteristics or features. The operationalization of the algorithm is called a model, which takes a statistical approach and creates consistent and robust predictions.

In supervised learning, a labeled dataset is used to train a model that generates predictions of the outcome. The dataset is split between training and validation, with the training dataset used to determine the parameters of the model and the validation dataset used to test the model's accuracy. The model can predict either a binary outcome or a numerical quantity, and the main challenge is to keep iterating between data, features, and algorithms until the error rate between the model prediction and expert prediction is satisfactory. Examples of supervised machine learning include email spam filtering and facial recognition on social media platforms.

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train a system to recognize known outcomes, while unsupervised learning discovers insights in data without preconceptions. Many companies already have labeled data that can be used to implement supervised machine learning models, such as insurance companies using decades of data to reduce fraud and healthcare systems correlating medical data with health diagnoses. Collaborative filtering algorithms are used for recommendations by companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Airbnb. The Nest thermostat uses autogenerated labeled data to change temperature based on prior habits. Israel-based Zebra Medical Vision offers technology to help radiologists make better diagnoses from medical scans.

Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to find natural groupings in data without labels and show patterns that may not be obvious to the observer. They are useful for gaining insights from social media, identifying customer groups and sentiment patterns, creating customer segments, and categorizing reasons for customer churn. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not suggest specific labels, but humans or other algorithms do the labeling and decide on potential actions. National security agencies and law enforcement organizations also use unsupervised learning algorithms to look for abnormal patterns in social media data to discern potential security threats.

Unsupervised learning has three main types of algorithms: 1. Clustering to group data and identify unique segments 2. Association rule mining to recommend additional products based on co-occurrence patterns 3. Anomaly detection to identify unusual observations. Examples of these algorithms include Netflix's taste communities, Amazon's product recommendations, and Ocado's discovery of a relationship between diapers and beer. Topic modeling is also used to find meaning in text-based data.

Reinforcement learning has the potential for impactful applications and requires a starting point and a performance function, with a trade-off between exploring and exploiting the model. Anomaly detection is often used in fraud detection, healthcare and machine maintenance. Netflix's algorithm for personalizing movie recommendations uses this trade-off approach.

Netflix uses a combination of exploration and exploitation to maximize the match between user and recommendation, systematically randomizing visuals to refine their prediction model. They dynamically cycle between periods of exploration and exploitation to learn about user preferences and improve engagement. The approach is based on the multiarmed bandit problem, a common class of models used in reinforcement learning that maximizes performance by minimizing regret. This approach is important in the deployment of AI for optimizing operating performance.

Multiarmed bandit algorithms balance exploration and exploitation to make operating decisions, from product recommendations to video game paths. Reinforcement learning, as seen in AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, involves software agents interacting with the environment to maximize a reward, with the latter not requiring external data input. These advancements in AI have spurred national efforts to achieve world-class leadership in AI.



Giving rules to an agent allows it to quickly learn to maximize rewards and perform better. Google's DeepMind team applied this to drug discovery and protein folding with superior results to scientists. 

Digital operating models require a state-of-the-art experimentation platform to test potential data-driven improvements at scale. 

An experimentation platform involves formalizing significant changes as hypotheses and testing them through randomized control trials. 

This approach ensures any prediction generated by algorithms actually has a causal effect on the outcome. 

The experimentation platform is a necessary component of the AI factory to ensure reliable impact.



A/B testing is a crucial part of experimentation platforms to test potential business improvements suggested by an AI factory at scale. 

Netflix has a fully integrated experimentation platform that is utilized to improve all aspects of its product experience, including algorithms, image selection, user interface changes, and more. 

Netflix tries to bring scientific rigor to all decision making by embracing experimentation as an integral component. 

The fully automated experimentation platform enables Netflix employees to run experiments at scale. 

The data pipeline, algorithm design and execution engine, and experimentation platform should all be embedded in software infrastructure to drive the operating activities of the digital firm.

The data platform provides a structured environment for software developers to build, deploy, and execute AI applications using a publish-subscribe methodology for APIs. The platform aggregates, cleans, refines, and processes data to make it consistently available through APIs, allowing for agile development and the creation of numerous AI applications. The platform also requires strategic investments in connectivity and infrastructure to integrate with data silos and avoid siloed structures. Clear interfaces enable decentralized innovation at the module level.

Clear and secure APIs enable independent agile teams or individual developers to focus on specific tasks without destroying the consistency of the whole, making it possible to share data with internal and external users. A well-designed data platform with APIs improves an organization's ability to focus on data governance and security, which is crucial for the valuable, sensitive, and private data captured from users, suppliers, partners, and employees. It allows for a centralized system with appropriate checks and balances on access and usage, inventorying assets carefully, and providing all stakeholders with necessary protection.



Defining clear and secure APIs is essential to AI factory as they control access to critical assets and data flow. 

APIs need to be carefully designed to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information. 

The infrastructure underlying an AI factory needs to be secure, scalable, and seamlessly connected to core digital processes. 

The development of an AI system for lung cancer tumor mapping demonstrates that any organization can build an AI factory.



The LISH AI factory developed a system for outlining lung cancer tumors using CT scans. 

The system was developed on an academic budget and deployed in only ten weeks. 

The LISH AI factory leverages crowdsourced algorithm design contests on Topcoder to solve a variety of problems. 

The system developed by LISH is as good as a Harvard-trained radiation oncologist. 

The system was developed by data scientists with no background in medical imaging, using data from 461 patients and three sequential contests. 

The top five contestants used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest algorithms to develop the system.

The text discusses the use of custom and published architectures and frameworks for object detection and localization, using open source algorithms. Phase 3 algorithms produced segmentations faster than a human expert, and the ensemble of the five best algorithms performed as well as a human radiation oncologist. The example is cited to demonstrate that an organization doesn't need to be rich in data, IT resources, or AI talent to construct an AI factory. The text also highlights the importance of firms' operating architecture as AI enables more operating processes. The next chapter discusses rearchitecting the firm. The chapter begins with Jeff Bezos' mandate that all teams should expose their data and functionality through service interfaces, and communicate with each other through these interfaces.

The text discusses an email sent by Jeff Bezos in 2002, where he mandated that all communication between teams at Amazon should be through service interface calls over the network. This mandate was necessary because the company's software infrastructure was cracking under pressure due to too much volume, too many products, and too many different businesses being sold on a network cobbled together through acquisitions. The Bezos memo is considered a seminal document in the digital transformation of business. The text highlights that the twenty-first-century firm is built on a highly modular digital foundation rather than a traditional organizational model with specialized and siloed processes.

Information technology has become the operating core of firms, replacing traditional labor- and asset-intensive organizations, and enabling firms to generate increasing returns to scale, scope, and learning. To achieve sustainable growth, digital firms require a different kind of operating model architected to take an integrated core of software, data, and AI and use it to power a new breed of organization. The relationship between the structure of an organization and the architecture of the technological systems that the organization works with is reflected in the organization and carries important implications for the evolution of firms.

Conway's law states that the design of integrated technology components requires frequent communication, leading to the mirroring hypothesis, which suggests that organizational ties correspond to technical patterns of dependency. The architecture of systems mirrors the architecture of organizations, and mutually reinforcing connections enhance quality and efficiency in work execution. Over time, these patterns can become an asset or a constraint on an organization's ability to respond to change. Architectural innovations can require changing the architecture between technological components and organizational structures.

Established firms face the danger of architectural inertia, which refers to their resistance to adapting to disruptive changes due to their existing routines and systems that reinforce each other. This makes it difficult to achieve transformations that require organizing work in new ways. This issue is prevalent in enterprise information technology over the past few decades, where IT is deployed along traditional operating and organizational boundaries, limiting its impact and potential. Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, aimed to break this inertia by transforming not only Amazon's technology but also its organization.

Traditional operating architectures consist of siloed functions and operating units that manage operational complexity by breaking an organization into smaller units. This model dates back to at least the Italian Renaissance, and one of the earliest known examples of distributed commercial operating architecture dates back to the fifteenth century in Prato, Italy. The first modern corporation may have been the Dutch East India Company, which achieved economies of scale by integrating various shipping portfolios and managing risk. Amazon's new model aims to build a software-, data-, and AI-driven firm by breaking down traditional operating architectures.

The company evolved into a successful multinational organization by using a siloed operating architecture and flexible managerial approaches. It dominated global trade in spices, silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles, and employed traditional craft methods until the Industrial Revolution brought mass production techniques that enabled specialization and standardization.

The Ford Motor Company revolutionized the automotive industry with the introduction of mass production techniques, including the moving chassis assembly line, which dramatically reduced costs and increased efficiency. The Model T became the first affordable car for American consumers and Ford became the largest manufacturer in the United States. Its operating model focused on standardization, specialization, and breaking down organizational silos to the smallest, most specialized tasks.



 General Motors gained an advantage over Ford by offering a wider range of cars at varying prices and creating autonomous product units. 

 Toyota's TPS operating model revolutionized the industry by prioritizing learning and problem-solving at all levels of the organization. 

 Mass production and specialization led to increasing economies of scale, greatly improving efficiencies and quality in manufacturing and service industries. 

 Traditional crafts were virtually eliminated as a result.



 Mass production concepts like specialization and standardization spread to service industries like supermarkets, fast food franchises, hotels, banks, energy companies, insurance providers, hospitals, and airlines. 

 Specialized and siloed operating models remain essential in modern manufacturing and service delivery. 

 Information technology enables modern manufacturing lines but does not transform the trajectory of operating models. 

 IT systems generally mirror firms' siloed and specialized structures.

The technology in many large enterprises has not changed the structure of the organization and data is often distributed and inconsistent due to siloed architecture and incompatible legacy technology. Integrating data across functional silos is a complicated and unreliable process. Traditional operating models have led to productivity and innovation, but also created limits to growth and value, as seen in the examples of Ford, General Motors, and Toyota.

Traditional organizations suffer from diseconomies of scale, scope, and learning as they grow and become more complex, leading to inefficiencies and limits to growth. The maximum efficient scale of an organization is shaped by its operating model, and traditional information technology has not significantly loosened these constraints. Integrating disparate IT systems is a long and painful process. The ability of a traditional organization to deliver value faces a curve of diminishing returns, with the number of users or complementors on a platform being a key parameter.

Traditional organizational structures and operating silos have limited the value that can be delivered by traditional firms, despite widespread improvements in management and operations and the deployment of enterprise IT. Amazon faced similar limitations due to silos in its organization, data, and technology, leading Bezos to envision a software- and data-driven operating model that required breaking organizational and technological silos. Amazon rearchitected its tasks, starting with the software, to expand its retail operations to unprecedented levels of scale, scope, and learning, resulting in a major transformation.

Bezos rebuilt Amazon's retail operation on top of a software platform, which gradually evolved to embed an AI factory. The organization was transformed according to new architectural boundaries, emphasizing the broad deployment of agile teams working within clearly established interfaces. Amazon's transformation produced challenges as well as successes, but the company eventually created a real software platform with a central, standardized set of services and clear APIs. The new platform required Amazon to rewrite virtually all of its e-commerce services, and the redesign of its retail platform led to the evolution of Amazon's development organization into a modular, distributed structure.

Amazon structures its teams to be small enough to ensure efficiency and independence while adhering to clear architectural rules to enable the sharing of common code and data. The company has become a leader in deploying AI and machine learning across all aspects of its business, with Amazon Web Services serving as its secret weapon in democratizing access to AI tools. AWS has successfully enabled customers to use prepackaged Amazon-developed systems, algorithms, and tools, as demonstrated by the success of its SageMaker toolkit. Amazon's internal machine learning conference has grown significantly in recent years.

Amazon's operating model, which aggregates software, data, and analytics while driving agile teams to focus on specific applications, is a trend among AI-driven firms. This new operating model poses an existential threat to traditional firms and departs radically from centuries of corporate evolution. Digital agents, unlike humans, can easily communicate with each other, connect to complementary activities, and embed processing instructions, which allows for limitless possibilities. This new architecture for AI-powered firms is constructed on code instead of human labor and exhibits a profoundly different operating model.

Digital operating architectures benefit from unlimited connectivity and data aggregation, allowing for a foundation encompassing data and technology to create or connect to new digital agents in the form of applications. This foundation is provided by an AI factory and enables operating tasks from customer relationship management to supply chains. Agile processes and digital operating architectures go hand in hand, and modern operating models focus on improving performance through learning, including A/B tests on experimentation platforms.

Digital operating models rely on centralized data and highly decentralized experimentation to prompt action by consumers and increase revenue. They also promote modularity and reuse of software and algorithms, often drawn from open source contributions. These models transform growth processes by removing traditional operating bottlenecks and allowing for almost infinite scalability through software and analytics.

Digitization of processes can lead to increased business connections, making them multisided and greatly expanding their scope. Analytics and AI thrive on data and can create increasing returns to scale, turbocharging value delivery to users. In an AI-powered operating model, management transforms to become designers, innovators, and integrators of digital systems that sense and respond to customer needs.

Digital, AI-centered operating models challenge traditional managerial and operational assumptions and require firms to rethink their nature and management teams. Despite the business potential, many traditional firms hesitate to fully commit to the required organizational transformation. Becoming an AI company requires balancing conviction with patience, as exemplified by Satya Nadella's leadership at Microsoft's Server and Tools group.

Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company into a cloud software company, including infrastructure like Azure and cloud-based applications like Office 365. In 2018, he announced plans for Microsoft's next transformation focused on the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, citing the increasing power and ubiquity of computing, advancing AI capabilities, and the merging of physical and virtual worlds. This technological change represents an opportunity for everyone, but it also requires responsibility and trustworthiness in the technologies created.

Microsoft underwent a major operating model transformation, including organizational changes and new leadership roles. This transformation is not unique to Microsoft, as many technology companies have reinvented themselves multiple times. Traditional firms must also become software-based, AI-driven companies accustomed to ongoing transformation. The chapter focuses on what it takes to transform into an AI company, highlighting key lessons learned from Microsoft and other companies. The chapter concludes with a description of the transformation at Fidelity Investments.

Microsoft had lost its way in terms of innovation, facing competition from the internet and antitrust scrutiny. It had also lost its developer focus and technical edge, as the developer community shrank and turned to open source alternatives. Nadella recognized the need for a new mission and strategy, going back to the origin of the company as a technology company aimed at driving innovation.

Microsoft's new mission is to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more, and its strategy involves becoming the productivity platform for the age of AI, with a services-based consumption orientation backed by a cloud-based architecture and enabled by AI capabilities. To become a leading cloud provider, Microsoft embraced open source and invested heavily in open source projects, contributing much of its own software into the open domain, which gained traction with the acquisition of GitHub in 2018.

Microsoft underwent significant transitions and experienced an exodus of experienced leaders to bring CEO Satya Nadella's cloud and AI strategy to life. The remaining team developed a laser focus on the new strategy, spending billions of dollars a year in CAPEX building their cloud. Microsoft had to undergo a major transition in the management team and deploy an efficient and responsive supply chain to compete with Amazon. After years of investment, Microsoft's relentless efforts are paying off.

Cloud-based architectures offer operational benefits such as improved customer alignment, real-time information on supply chain problems, and analytics opportunities. Customer usage data is tracked and integrated into data platforms, enabling powerful analytics and generating essential improvements. Azure was initially run as a separate, autonomous organization causing challenges for Microsoft, but it was later integrated into the Server and Tools business to transform the core.

Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, brought the Azure team to the center of the company to transform its core. Bill Laing, an experienced Microsoft executive, led the Azure team and worked to make it easier to use and compatible with traditional Microsoft products. Scott Guthrie succeeded Laing and focused on making the platform more user-friendly and easier to deploy with Microsoft's traditional customers. Guthrie transformed the Azure organization's structure, processes, and value system, making it increasingly powerful, business-friendly, and compatible with other Microsoft products.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella integrated Azure software and hardware teams under cohesive, business-focused goals led by Jason Zander, Todd Homdahl, Rani Borkar, and Mike Neil. They adopted agile methods and improved responsiveness to operations, and layered sophisticated machine learning and AI capabilities across their infrastructure and products. Nadella's announcement accelerated AI technology development and product introductions, but more than investing in AI-related projects, Nadella emphasized putting AI at the core of Microsoft.

Microsoft's AI strategy centers around the Azure infrastructure and making their powerful AI accessible to developers. They have introduced AI-driven services such as search, knowledge, vision, language, and speech APIs, and Azure Data Factory for data integration. Kurt DelBene, a Microsoft veteran, led the transformation of Microsoft's data assets, internal IT, and operations teams as their chief digital officer. Nadella chose someone with extensive product experience to build Microsoft's own AI factory as the new foundation of its data- and software-centric operating model. Microsoft had to shift from a reactive to a proactive mode in terms of their IT operations.

To build and deploy the software foundations of a new operating model, Microsoft had to transform IT under Kurt DelBene. He changed the name of the organization to Core Services Engineering, reduced reliance on outsourcing, and integrated IT with operations and strategy. DelBene's team identified all data in the company and assembled catalogs for different data sources to build machine learning models. They can now preempt issues, from bad contracts to cyber breaches, using AI and ML models built on top of everything. They can search across their entire data sets and do analysis.

Microsoft's Core Services is a horizontal platform that provides components for the processes that run the entire company, breaking away from previous siloed IT models. It partners with internal product teams to inject deep expertise and make Microsoft products more enterprise-ready. Core Services is at the center of Microsoft's transformation, connecting the organization to a common software component library, algorithm repository, and data catalog to digitize, enable, and deploy digital processes across the entire company. Microsoft has also confronted the broader implications of AI and appointed Brad Smith as the new president with explicit responsibilities to run Microsoft's corporate, external, and legal governance.

Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, works with the company's research and Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs (CELA) teams to tackle issues related to privacy, security, accessibility, sustainability, and digital inclusion across the company. They collaborated to release a book called "The Future Computed" that outlines Microsoft's perspective on AI and its impact on society. The partnership was formed after the backlash faced by Microsoft's AI-powered chat bot, Tay. Together, they developed clear guidelines and identified six AI principles to create responsible bots: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. The CELA team members are integrated into various activities to manage the clash between engineering-driven and risk-prone decisions.

The article discusses the transformation of operating models in traditional enterprises towards digitization and AI capabilities, highlighting five guiding principles for an effective transformation process, including the development of strategic clarity and commitment, unity in company transformation, and rebuilding the company on a new integrated foundation. The article emphasizes the importance of a clear and compelling vision to drive alignment across all facets of the effort.

The article emphasizes the importance of coordination and collaboration across functions to refocus the company on a foundation of analytics and AI, which can lead to dramatic business model innovation. Bringing clarity to the technical goals of the transformation is critical, with a strong focus on centralizing data assets, implementing clear guidelines for data use and protection, and establishing standard policies, components, and architecture to deploy sophisticated AI. The article cites Microsoft's cloud and AI orientation as an example of business model expansion through digital transformation.

Traditional IT organizations often resist transformation efforts due to their focus on operating a complex back office and lack of expertise in innovation and analytics. Developing a product-focused mentality and embedding traditional processes in software and algorithms are key to building an AI-centric operating model. Agile methods are essential in conjunction with a transformed, data-centric architecture for building AI-driven applications quickly.

Transformation to an AI-centric operating model requires a major cultural shift towards a software culture and mindset. Building a foundation of capability in software, data sciences, and advanced analytics is crucial, and requires hiring and grooming talent with the right skill sets, including data and analytics product managers. The role of data and analytics product manager will expand, creating a new generation of business leaders with a combination of skills and capabilities.

The adoption of AI by firms brings both benefits and challenges, including issues of privacy and cybersecurity. Clear multidisciplinary governance is necessary, involving collaboration across different disciplines and functions, including legal and corporate affairs. Companies should actively address legal and ethical exposure related to AI and engage with stakeholders outside the firm. Microsoft is not the only company seeking digital transformation through analytics and AI capabilities.

A study of over 350 enterprises found that those with developed analytics and AI capabilities have superior business performance. The research evaluated various aspects of data infrastructure, analytics, and AI capabilities and assembled the findings into an AI maturity index. Firms at the top of the sample had integrated data platforms and leveraged AI and ML for operational automation and business insights. The benefits of an AI-enabled operating model are significant.



 Leading organizations are realizing significant benefits from their investments in data and analytics across various business functions, including automation of decisions and aiding complex decision-making. These firms consolidate data to develop a single version of the truth, utilize business intelligence tools to develop tailored customer experiences, and optimize advertising effectiveness. They also use data to improve engineering, manufacturing, and operations, often through consolidation of information across the product development life cycle and supply chain, and by using IoT technologies to instrument their products and services with connected sensors.



 The best-performing firms invest heavily in developing data, analytics, and AI-centered capabilities, driving a change in their operating models and culture to embrace AI. They build sophisticated data platforms, use data for forecasting and recommendations, and deploy applications rapidly through agile teams. Investing in AI capability has a significant financial impact, as shown in Table 5-1. Firms progress through stages of siloed data, pilots, data hubs, and AI factory, with the need for rearchitecting the organization becoming more critical at each stage.



 Organizations need to aggregate data from various sources for identifying companywide opportunities, which requires substantial investment and may face organizational resistance. 

 A clear, single source of truth is crucial for decision-making and is often achieved through a centralized data sciences and analytics organization, while allowing flexibility for individual functions and units. 

 Going from a data hub to an AI factory requires further investment, a standard operating model for AI, and emphasis on policies and governance, including privacy and bias. 

 Building AI skills and capabilities across the organization is an ongoing journey, beyond engineering organizations, to shape the critical path to the customer and society.



 Fidelity Investments evolved towards becoming an AI-first company after executives took note of Google and Microsoft's moves towards AI. 

 Executive Vice President Vipin Mayar was tasked with leading Fidelity's AI Center of Excellence and worked with business units to identify key AI initiatives and use cases. 

 Fidelity prioritized its AI strategy, hired top data scientists, and expanded recruitment efforts. 

 The company also developed data- and AI-focused product management and built AI as a core capability.



 Fidelity developed an integrated data strategy centered around a 360-degree view of the customer and their interactions with the company, and created its own analytics software stack for machine learning. 

 The data platform tracked and integrated over 36 million user profiles, interactions, and voice calls, providing customer insights to improve services and value to clients. 

 Fidelity also adopted agile methods to increase agility and decision-making speed, breaking down traditional silos and working together on agile teams. 

 Fidelity launched new applications in two-week scrums to track customer satisfaction, estimate risk profiles, and develop investment recommendation systems, tested on an experimentation platform before deployment. 

 Fidelity prioritized AI investments to enhance customer experience, understand customer preferences, and recommend personalized investment strategies.



 Fidelity's investments will focus on revenue growth, optimizing operating processes, scalability, and generating fundamental business insights with AI. 

 Fidelity is driving its data- and AI-centric operating model across its businesses, using software and algorithms to improve performance and customer experience. 

 Fidelity and other firms are undergoing operating model transformation, driving new capabilities and business opportunities, and need a new way to approach strategy in the digital economy.

The article discusses the need for a new lens to evaluate the options for firms in today's economy, which is characterized by the blurring of traditional boundaries and the emergence of powerful network effects. The authors draw an analogy between the structure of the World Wide Web and business networks resulting from digital connections. They predict that some firms would emerge as keystones, platform firms, or hub firms and become much more connected and powerful than others. The strategic dynamics of AI and networks go hand in hand, and the architecture of the economy is being reconfigured into a huge, all-encompassing, AI-powered network.

The article highlights the importance of digital networks in today's economy and how competitive advantage is defined by the ability to control and harvest data from these networks. The most central organizations in connecting businesses and extracting value through powerful analytics and AI are the ones that will sustain and grow competitive advantage across different industries. Strategic analysis should focus on the structure and importance of the connections a firm creates across industries and the flows of data through the networks they connect to. The article predicts that network analysis will increasingly shape strategic thinking in the future.

The text offers guidance on conducting network analysis in the context of business strategy, based on research by HBS colleague Feng Zhu. The chapter explores the critical interactions between a business and the rest of the economy, and how networks can shape the dynamics of value creation and capture. The new strategic problem involves understanding the open and distributed connections across firms, with each firm connected to a large number of networks across disparate industries, and accumulating both network and learning effects. Network effects describe the value added by increasing the number of connections within and across networks, while learning effects capture the value added by increasing the amount of data flowing through them. The chapter concludes by summarizing the key implications of network analysis for business strategy.

The text discusses the value of network and learning effects in business strategy, as represented by Figure 6-1, which shows how the value created by different businesses can increase with scale due to these effects. The aim is to increase the value created at scale and capture the resulting competitive advantage by moving from a typical diminishing returns curve to one with increasing returns. This logic can apply not only to tech companies but also to businesses in traditional sectors. The example of the healthcare sector is explored.



 Network analysis involves mapping economic networks and examining data flows to gain advantage through AI. 

 A pharmaceutical company used a disease management app to track the progression of Parkinson's disease in patients and optimize treatment. 

 The data and access enabled by the app could also be valuable to providers of related services such as pharmacies, insurers, and physicians, and create connections among patients and service providers. 

 Strategic analysis should examine the nature and potential of all applications to discover what uses may be made of complementary networks. 

 The connections created can provide great synergies with the company's core business. 

 The app creates opportunities to dramatically increase patient reach and create new value across networks.



 Engaging patient networks and enabling patient-to-patient interactions can deepen loyalty and foster relationships. 

 Connecting with insurers, physicians, and health providers can amplify the impact of new data-driven insights and improve overall treatment effectiveness. 

 Various networks can generate new opportunities for monetization from insurance providers or advertisers, increasing the value curve. 

 To understand the possibilities, analyze each network separately and then analyze the interactions and potential synergies across the networks. 

 Factors influencing value creation dynamics and value capture are impacted by the network structure.

The value of a digital product or service increases as more users adopt it due to network effects. This concept is demonstrated through the example of the fax machine and is also applicable to social media platforms. The exact increase in value varies depending on context and can be modeled in different ways, but the important takeaway is that adding users increases a network's intrinsic utility. Traditional products do not typically generate network effects.

The value of a network increases as more users join, creating network effects. This concept applies to direct network effects where users value the presence of other users, as seen in messaging apps and social networks, and indirect network effects where users in one category value the presence of users in another category, as seen in Uber and Airbnb. The basic operating model of a platform hosting a network is to enable a match between users and capture the value generated by network effects. Traditional products, such as pens, do not exhibit network effects.

Network effects can be one-sided, with users valuing the search index on Google or Baidu, while advertisers value access to users. One type of network effect can be leveraged to generate another. The relationship between network scale and value is complex, and the advantage gained from weak network effects is less sustainable in the long term. Netflix is an example of a business that can reach value quickly.

Netflix's network effects are weak compared to YouTube's, which has a community of content creators with little incentive to post on other sites. Strong network effects have fewer competitors and increased market concentration. Learning effects add value to existing network effects or generate value in their own right. For example, Google's search business benefits from learning effects as its algorithms figure out common search patterns. Bing partnered with Yahoo! to increase its user base, but it didn't benefit from the same learning effects as Google.

The value created by a firm's algorithms can be amplified by learning effects which are dependent on scale and the amount of data used to train them. The accuracy of most algorithms rises with the square root of the number of data points, and when more than one algorithm drives a business, their combined learning effects can compound. Competitive advantage also depends on the type and uniqueness of algorithms used and the scale of required data.

The defensibility of a business built on AI algorithms depends on the uniqueness and scale of the required data. Learning and network effects can reinforce competitive advantage by amplifying the impact of scale and scope on value. Network clustering also affects the sustainability of network-based business models, with global networks being more defensible than clustered ones.

The home-sharing market requires global brand awareness to attract enough participants for a liquid marketplace, making it difficult for competitors to enter. Only one competitor, HomeAway/Vrbo, has achieved scale. Global networks are concentrated around critical hubs with high barriers to competition, and sustaining profitability is easy for dominant players. In contrast, Uber's network is highly clustered and fragmented, making it easier for competitors to enter. Clustered networks are typically highly competitive, and any competitor with local scale can achieve similar efficiencies.

Uber faces local competition from various companies in major cities, and clustered networks are vulnerable to competition. The clustering phenomenon applies to various industries, and global hubs do not emerge in clustered networks. The strength and structure of network and learning effects can change over time, making markets more or less competitive. In the past, most PC applications were client-based, defining the relevant local network of Microsoft Windows.

During the late 1990s, Windows was dominant with six million dedicated developers. However, the rise of internet-based applications and services led to a shift towards web-based and mobile applications that worked across different operating systems. This resulted in a decrease in the strength of Windows' network effect and led to less market concentration. With the ease of digital networks, options for value capture have grown dramatically, allowing for careful usage metering and sophisticated pricing algorithms.

Sophisticated pricing approaches allow for careful usage metering and outcome-based pricing, but not all the value created for a user network can be captured. The ability to capture value on a digital business network depends on factors such as competitive solutions and customer willingness to pay. Network effects offer new value capture options, such as charging for access to a network or monetizing services by charging each side separately. Companies with two-sided indirect network effects have more options for value capture. Multihoming is important for users to reduce dependence on a single network.



Multihoming is a situation where users or service providers can form ties with multiple platforms or hub firms at the same time. 

Competition from other hubs challenging a network's ability to capture value from the network, especially if switching costs are low. 

Multihoming is common among smartphone app developers but the vast majority of consumers single-home to either iOS or Android phones. 

In industries such as ride-hailing and home-sharing, multihoming is prevalent on both sides of the platform, leading to constant competition and challenges in generating profits.



Multihoming hinders profitability in ride- and home-sharing services, so platform owners attempt to reduce it by locking in one side of the market or both. 

Approaches to reducing multihoming include offering incentives for exclusive use of a platform, providing tools and advantages exclusively to power users, and signing exclusive contracts with publishers. 

Multihoming is still common due to the low adoption cost of multiple platforms, and profitability remains limited.

The article discusses the challenges faced by marketplaces, such as disintermediation, where customers bypass the platform to connect directly. Marketplaces can deter disintermediation by using strategies such as requiring users to conduct all transactions on the platform or providing additional value, such as insurance or dispute resolution services. However, these strategies may not always be effective and can make the platform cumbersome to use, making it vulnerable to competitors. Therefore, enhancing the value for users of conducting business through the hub may be a more honorable way to discourage disintermediation.

The article discusses the relationship between trust and disintermediation in online marketplaces. As trust between users increases, disintermediation can occur, reducing the need for the platform. To reduce disintermediation, platforms can offer complementary services instead of relying on transaction fees. Network bridging, where a platform connects to other networks, can also improve a firm's business model.



Connecting to multiple networks can improve the ability to create and capture value by building important synergies. Examples include Google's bridging of search and advertising, and Alibaba's bridging of e-commerce and financial services through its payment network. Data-based assets are useful across many scenarios and multiple network sides. Hub firms like Amazon and Alibaba move into many different markets by leveraging their critical mass in users to capture value on new and different networks. These networks mutually reinforce each other's market position and help to create new connections across previously separate economic networks.



Successful network hubs sustain each other's scale and drive connections across previously disconnected industries. Strategic network analysis involves mapping the major networks a business is connected to, evaluating their potential for value creation and capture, and identifying key factors that can strengthen or weaken network effects. Uber serves as an example of a business with multiple networks, including riders, drivers, food providers, health-care providers, and grocery partners, among others. The number of networks will likely grow as Uber searches for additional value capture opportunities.



Uber's main businesses do not have direct network effects and there is no value to riders or drivers from the presence of others. 

There is a negative impact due to more competition for rides in close proximity. 

Uber's geographical clustering weakens network effects, making profitability of its core service always challenged by low-cost competitors. 

Uber benefits from important learning effects through the accumulation and analysis of extensive data.



Uber's learning effects are important but may not ensure sustained profitability. 

Extensive multi-homing is a problem for Uber's ride-hailing app. 

Disintermediation is not common due to measures put in place by Uber. 

Uber faces extensive competition and profitability is not assured in its core geographies. 

However, Uber shows promise in connecting additional networks to its core networks of drivers and riders for future profitability. 

Bridging opportunities enabled by the intrinsic value of its core service can enable additional value creation and capture.

The book "Competing in the Age of AI" by Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani discusses the impact of artificial intelligence on businesses and provides strategies for companies to become successful in this new age. The book is divided into 10 chapters, covering topics such as rethinking the firm, the AI factory, becoming an AI company, strategic collisions, and the ethics of digital scale. The authors emphasize the need for a leadership mandate to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. The book is available from Harvard Business Review Press and is eligible for quantity sales discounts.

The text provides information about purchasing a book titled "Competing in the Age of AI" by Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani, including contact information for bulk sales and permission requests. The book discusses how artificial intelligence is transforming businesses and the economy, and how firms must rethink their operations and competition strategies in the age of AI.

The book "Competing in the Age of AI" by Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani discusses how AI is transforming businesses and the economy, requiring firms to rethink their operating architecture and strategy. The book also addresses ethical challenges and the new set of leadership challenges arising from the age of AI. The text includes a story about a painting created with the help of AI as an example of the technology's capabilities.

Scientists and experts used learning algorithms to create a new Rembrandt portrait, with AI becoming a force in the arts and expanding artistic possibilities. Google's Arts and Machine Intelligence program is exploring creative practices and applying style-transfer techniques across different media. AI is being used to create completely new works of art, transforming the method and process of conceiving and creating art. AICAN is an art-generating algorithm that produces novelty without significant help from human artists, drawing from a vast assemblage of paintings to create new works inspired by established styles.

AI algorithms not only expand creation and distribution methods but also model the course of art history, offering insight into art's progression from figuration to abstraction. AI is becoming pervasive in all fields and changing the nature of organizations, becoming the new operational foundation of businesses. AI is transforming how companies operate and compete by shaping the execution of processes through software instructions and algorithms. The book "Competing in the Age of AI" describes the profound implications of AI for business, as it becomes the universal engine of execution in a digital age.

The use of digital, AI-driven processes in operational systems is transforming the way firms operate, enabling digital scalability, greater scope, and learning. Even weak AI is already enough to transform the nature of firms and how they operate. This is already being seen in the explosive growth of firms like Facebook and Tencent.

The emergence of digital operating models and AI is transforming competition and changing how industries function and the way the economy operates. Understanding these new opportunities and challenges has become essential to all, as many time-honored assumptions about strategy and leadership no longer apply. The disruption caused by digital photography serves as an example of how new technology can dramatically transform the economy, creating challenges for existing competitors.



 Digitizing photography completely transformed the nature and variety of activities connected to photography, making it easy and free to share pictures on social media. This gave rise to new companies with massively scalable digital operating models. The vast number of digital photos taken every day is stored in the cloud, where it can be analyzed by algorithms, powering the improvement of algorithms used for facial recognition, photo sorting, and image enhancement. Social platforms can automatically identify family, friends, affinities, and backgrounds. Photo apps are already recommending products, services, and news feeds that users might like.



Digitizing photography enabled the emergence of a new breed of companies with a different operating model, changing not only the photography industry but reshaping the world around it. Digital representation is infinitely scalable, connectable to other complementary activities, and can embed processing instructions, making it easily trainable and continuously improving. The full potential of digital networks, data, algorithms, and AI is being released by firms designed for it.

The digitization of photography created new opportunities and gave rise to companies with scalable digital operating models. The more a company is designed to optimize digitization, the greater its potential for scale, scope, and learning. Traditional players that could not adapt, such as Kodak, were overwhelmed by digital operating models. Digital operating models create value and capture value differently, leading to a fundamentally different way to compete. However, the unconstrained growth and unrestrained impact of digital operating models raise new risks, such as privacy, cybersecurity, bias, and fake news.



Digital operating models can greatly improve a company's scalability, scope, and learning potential, leading to a fundamentally different way of creating and capturing value. Traditional companies that cannot adapt to the digital age risk being overwhelmed by digital competitors that operate differently. Digital firms require new approaches to leadership, regulation, and ethics due to their unconstrained growth and impact on the economy, environment, and society. Amazon is a prime example of how a digital operating model can transform traditional industries by leveraging digital technology, analytics, and AI/ML to scale, extend scope, and learn. Traditional businesses are limited by their operating model, which becomes increasingly complex as they grow, leading to operational costs and service level issues.

Amazon's digitized systems offer advantages in scale, scope, and learning, allowing for a more scalable enterprise that delivers an unprecedented range of products and services with pinpointed targeting. Digitization of tasks leads to better management and improvement, as seen in Amazon's order-taking system and product suggestions algorithm. The algorithm ingests vast amounts of data on customer behavior to suggest potentially appealing products, and its performance improves with every relevant consumer and product, making it more efficient than traditional employee-based product suggestions.

Amazon's digital operating model, which centers on the broad-based application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced robotics, allows for scalability and efficiency. Software and AI are increasingly used in critical workflows such as demand forecasting, warehouse management, supply chain management, and capacity planning, while people are deployed on the edge of the digital network. Amazon's service improves with volume, while traditional businesses suffer from complexity costs, leading to industry transformation.

Amazon's digital operating model utilizes AI, machine learning, and robotics to achieve scalability and efficiency. The company digitizes operational excellence and leverages its AI platform Alexa to transform traditional tasks and connect users to a wide range of services and products. Amazon's model scales well, has transformed industries, and has become a quintessential driver of industry transformation.

Amazon's digital operating model, based on AI and machine learning, allows for scalability and easy application across different areas. Alexa, the voice interface for Amazon's AI platform, is rapidly expanding in functionality and capabilities. Amazon's model is disrupting traditional industries and challenging competitors, like Walmart, to transform their own operating models to remain competitive. However, Amazon's growth and impact raise concerns about potential dislocations in the economy and scrutiny from regulators. Walmart is adopting a more digital and AI-enabled operating model to confront Amazon's challenge.

Walmart is using data, analytics, and AI to transform its business and has acquired digital firms and partnered with Microsoft to drive digital transformation. While Walmart's online revenues have grown, it needs to leverage data, analytics, and AI to transform its in-store experience. Walmart is experimenting with bringing online experiences into stores using cameras, sensors, computer vision, and deep learning software to complement the online experience and better meet consumer expectations.

Retailers like Walmart are using data and analytics to track customer engagement patterns throughout the store and improve store offerings, product placement, layout, and supply chain decisions. They are also working on using real-time information from personal devices to recognize customers and personalize the experience. Implementation challenges include navigating the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and the role of traditional salespeople. The store experience is already changing, with Amazon Go stores having no cashiers and using technology to track movements and purchases. With a digitally enabled supply chain, the bottleneck in building more stores is simply accessing real estate.

The widespread adoption of app-based digital payment systems, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, is driving a wave of new applications leveraging resulting data, analytics, and AI. Beggars and street performers can now accept digital payments, and stores and restaurants are increasingly requesting app-based payments instead of credit cards. China's Tencent, the maker of the WeChat app, is reshaping various businesses and professions with its digital technology. Tencent adapted ICQ functionality and centralized user data to create a more accessible and versatile product that has since become an all-encompassing platform.

Tencent is a Chinese tech company that built its success through its messaging network and mobile messaging application, WeChat. WeChat provides various functionalities, including sending and receiving money, and has an open platform that allows external services to be plugged in. Tencent has expanded its services by analyzing data through machine learning algorithms, which enables automation and informs an expanding variety of services, including those in the financial and healthcare industries. Tencent and its arch competitor, Ant Financial, leverage their connections with large masses of consumers to transform industries.

Tencent and Ant Financial have become major players in the global economy with their broad range of continuously improving products, including the most widely used payment service, the largest money market fund, and one of the largest small business loan networks. Their success has led to attention from communities and regulators, putting them on a collision course with various industries. Meanwhile, the emergence of digital networks and AI challenges traditional assumptions about work and institutions, rendering skills and talents obsolete.

The deployment of AI could threaten jobs and our economy as our lives become more embedded in digital networks, leading to cybersecurity concerns. This new age is transforming business and society, requiring leaders to manage, transform, and control their organizations in new ways. The book aims to help leaders appreciate the potential impact, opportunities, and challenges of digital organizations and leverage existing strengths to support new strategies.



Several firms such as Mastercard, Fidelity Investments, Walmart, and Roche are investing in AI and changing the way they operate. 

AI presents new opportunities for startups, established firms, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs for new economic, social, and political institutions, and even for artists. 

AI-driven transformation prompts the creation of new companies and motivates old companies to adopt new operating models for sustained growth and transformation. 

The book provides leaders of organizations, old and new, startups, and regulatory institutions with frameworks for understanding, competing, and operating in the age of AI. 

Over the past decade, the authors have led research projects at Harvard Business School to understand digital transformation, networks, and the impact of AI across companies.



The authors engaged with a wide range of organizations, from tiny startups to multinational corporations, and from internet pioneers to traditional organizations, and distilled what they have learned in this book. 

The book addresses a new observation that a new breed of firm, characterized by digital scale, scope, and learning, is transforming our economy and eclipsing traditional managerial methods and constraints. 

The transformation is about more than technology; it requires rearchitecting how the firm works and changing the way it gathers and uses data, reacts to information, makes operating decisions, and executes operating tasks. 

The work stands on foundations built by many others, including Carliss Baldwin, Kim Clark, Hal Varian, and Carl Shapiro.

The book explores the impact of digital ecosystems, platforms, and communities on company strategy and business models, and the increasing central role of computers in changing the nature of work. It argues that the combination of these factors with the impact of software, analytics, and AI on networks and organizations is giving rise to a new kind of firm, defining a new economic age. The book is divided into ten chapters, with chapters 2 and 3 focusing on a new concept of the firm and the core of the new firm, respectively, using examples from digital unicorns and Netflix. The book targets managers, entrepreneurs, and society as a whole.

Chapters 4-8 of the book "AI Superpowers" focus on the strategic and operational implications of AI for firms. Chapter 4 examines the need for a new operating architecture, using Amazon as an example, while Chapter 5 explores the transformation journey of becoming an AI company, with Microsoft as a case study. Chapter 6 discusses strategic network analysis and its implications for firms, while Chapter 7 looks at competitive dynamics between digital and traditional firms. Chapter 8 addresses the ethical considerations surrounding AI, including issues of bias and privacy.

The book "Digital Scale, Scope, and Learning" discusses the ethical challenges created by digital networks and AI, including digital amplification, algorithmic bias, data security and privacy, and platform control. The book also highlights new rules and responsibilities for business leaders and regulators, and offers insights for adapting to AI-powered transformation. The goal is to prepare organizations for the challenges and opportunities of the new digital era.

The text discusses the need for both legacy and new companies to embrace and invest in understanding, deploying, and managing new strategies and capabilities for sustainable growth in the age of AI. It highlights the success of Ant Financial, which leverages data to offer a wide range of services and respond to users' needs. The chapter "Rethinking the Firm" explores how AI is changing the way firms create, capture, and deliver value.

Ant Financial is using AI to power various functions in financial services, transforming the industry and competing with incumbents with fewer employees serving more customers. The chapter explores Ant Financial, Ocado, and Peloton as examples of new templates for 21st-century digital firms using software, data, and AI as operational foundations. Google, an established firm placing AI at the core of its business, is also discussed. These companies are leading the transformation of the economy by creating, capturing, and delivering value to customers. The chapter breaks down the traditional firm's nature and purpose and focuses on how these companies are forging a new path.

Firms provide long-term contracts to coordinate tasks and lower transaction costs needed to create products and services. The value of a firm is shaped by its business model (how it creates and captures value) and its operating model (how it delivers value to customers). The business model encompasses the firm's strategy for providing and monetizing its unique set of goods or services, while the operating model includes the systems, processes, and capabilities that enable the delivery of goods and services. The business model creates value for customers and the company captures some of that value.



 A company's value proposition or customer promise is the particular problem they are solving for customers. 

 Factors that contribute to value creation can include quality, styling, comfort, ride quality, cost, and brand. 

 Value creation can vary between products and services, such as cars and ride-sharing. 

 Ride-sharing value creation involves factors such as driver availability, trust in company policies, customer ratings, ease of use, and cost. 

 A company's approach to value creation requires choosing the precise problem they are solving for the customer and positioning in the marketplace.



Value capture is the value a company captures from a customer, which should be less than the value it creates for the customer. 

For auto companies, value capture is based on the margin between the sales price and the cost of manufacturing, while ride-sharing companies rely on pay-per-use consumption. 

Margin still matters for ride-sharing, and the price should be greater than the cost. 

Digital firms innovate in the business model, experimenting and recombining various aspects of value creation and value capture. 

In a fully digitized business, value creation and capture can be separated more easily, and often come from different stakeholders.

The operating model is crucial in delivering value to customers and shaping the actual value of a firm. It involves complex activities, technology, and capital investments, but ultimately aims to deliver value at scale, achieve sufficient scope, and engage in sufficient learning. The main challenges for executives in designing an operating model are to drive economies of scale and scope, as well as to develop the operating capability to improve and innovate.

Firms are structured to efficiently produce more goods and services than individuals can, with economies of scale and scope. Scope refers to the range of activities a firm performs, and economies of scope enable corporations to establish multiple lines of business. Learning is essential to drive continuous improvement, increase operating performance, and develop new products and services. From Bell Laboratories to Toyota, modern corporations rely on innovation and learning to remain competitive.

The alignment between a firm's business model and operating model is crucial for optimizing performance. Successful firms design and implement operating models that align with their business models, driving scale, scope, and learning objectives. However, expanding each operational dimension increases the complexity of traditional operating models, limiting the value created and captured by firms. Digital firms are different as they deploy a new operating model that enables greater scalability, broader scope, and faster learning and adaptation. Digital technology replaces labor as the bottleneck in operating activities, transforming the critical path in the delivery of value.

Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Alibaba, was created to facilitate payments and build trust between buyers and sellers on its e-commerce platform through an escrow system. Ant Financial's business model involves offering a substitute for trust in the form of an escrow-based financial payment service that facilitates transactions between merchants and buyers. The company must create value for consumers and merchants, and value capture occurs through fees charged for transactions. Ant Financial's operating model is designed for scale and relies heavily on digital technology to remove traditional operational constraints.

Alipay is a digital payment service in China that charges a transaction fee to merchants. Its growth strategy involves increasing the number of buyers and sellers on the platform, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies the value created by trust in the service. Alipay's success was fueled by its availability to all individuals and businesses in China, exponential growth, and the incorporation of QR code technology.

Alipay is a versatile digital payment service in China that allows users to make small transactions, from buying coffee to paying utility bills. Its spinoff from Alibaba was driven by concerns over possible government regulation of online payment systems. Ant Financial, the new company that Alipay became a part of, aimed to benefit society by facilitating small transactions and expanded its scope of services to its clients and the larger ecosystem. Yue Bao, an investment platform, was introduced to allow Alipay users to earn interest on money in their accounts.

Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Alibaba, launched Yue Bao, a money market fund with no minimum deposit and accessible via mobile phone, which quickly became the largest money market fund in the world, collecting over $81 billion within nine months. Ant Financial also expanded its financial services offerings, including personal investment and wealth management, credit scoring, internet banking, insurance, and other services accessible through its Alipay app. By 2019, Ant Financial had over 700 million users and dominated the Chinese financial services market, controlling 54% of mobile payments.

Ant Financial and its Alipay services dominate the Chinese financial services market with 54% control of mobile payments, while Tencent's WeChat controls 38%. Ant Financial began expanding globally in 2015, investing in mobile payment systems in Asia and pursuing partnerships and acquisitions abroad. Ant Financial's business model relies on AI-enabled digital automation, such as MYbank's 3-1-0 loan processing system that requires no human interaction and uses credit scores and AI-driven risk control strategies.

Ant Financial's MYbank uses data analytics, AI, and cloud computing to provide loans to small businesses and individual entrepreneurs. The bank processes billions of transfers daily and can handle up to 120,000 transactions per second. With a sophisticated, integrated data platform, AI is used to personalize, optimize revenue, and make recommendations. The platform collects information on everything users do, from their spending habits to their preferred transportation. The bank has served more than 5 million customers with loans averaging RMB 17,000 and can process loans at a cost of only RMB 2, compared to RMB 2,000 at traditional banks. MYbank does not require physical bank locations or a large workforce.

Ant Financial's Alipay uses real-time digital checks to ensure transaction and player legitimacy by analyzing buyer and seller account information and device involvement. Ant Financial relies on data from internal and external sources to calculate credit scores and isolates traits common in both good and bad borrowers. Algorithms calculate credit scores on all borrowers and their behavioral data in real-time, with the analysis improving the quality of decision-making over time. Every action taken on the platform affects a business's credit score.

Ant Financial, the parent company of Alipay, offers perks to customers with good credit while requiring those with low scores to put down additional deposits. It has a fraud prevention monitoring system and an experimentation platform to learn about new features and products. Ant Financial's expansion was due to focusing on various data sources and combining analytics with agile innovation. It uses scenario-based prototyping to develop new applications and leverages data mining to automate customer issue resolution. It also removes human bottlenecks.

The digital operating model involves avoiding direct human intervention in processes that drive customer value by digitizing them and using a central repository of data to gather and analyze customer needs. Many new operating models automate data-driven actions and remove human tasks from delivery bottlenecks. Ant Financial and Amazon are examples of companies that have successfully implemented this model. Removing human and organizational bottlenecks has significant benefits.



Digital operating models are easier to scale due to the marginal cost of serving an additional user being close to zero. 

Digital technologies are modular and allow for easy connections with external partners and communities, increasing firm scope and value. 

Digitizing the operating model enables faster learning and innovation through accumulated data and smaller, agile product teams. 

In a digital operating model, employees do not deliver, as much of the operational complexity is solved through software and analytics or outsourced to external partners.



Digital organizations that use software automation and algorithms to deliver products or services remove traditional operating bottlenecks and transform the growth process. 

Peloton founder, John Foley, transformed the traditional stationary bike into a digitally enhanced fitness product that removed constraints of time, space, and capacity. 

Peloton's product is a high-quality indoor bicycle with an integrated tablet for displaying fitness programming, which customers pay about $2,200 for.

Peloton's business model, which includes a digital operating model, offers customers an in-home fitness experience with access to great instructors and community of fellow members. Customers pay for the equipment and a monthly subscription for unlimited access to fitness programming that includes live and previously recorded workouts. Peloton's value creation mechanisms include unlimited classes and connectivity among its members.

Peloton has formed subcommunities around instructors, geographies, and training styles, creating a communal experience with live-streamed classes and leaderboards. Peloton's value capture model combines product sales and subscriptions, with a high renewal rate of 95%. The company's operating model focuses on scaling the fitness experience through live-streamed classes and offering a range of fitness options. The company's digital content and community can be accessed via a mobile app for a monthly subscription fee.

Peloton is a product-focused company that aims to design the iPhone of fitness equipment. It employs over 70 software engineers who design the company's systems for a version of Android. Peloton's success is sparked by a great product and a highly scalable digital service that delivers the experience to a rapidly increasing audience of enthusiasts. The company's growth bottlenecks are shifted to internal digitized systems or to resources outside the firm. Peloton is not subject to the most significant traditional operational constraints on growth, and the digital interfaces in Peloton's software easily expand the scope of the business.

Peloton has built a sophisticated analytics platform and digitally streamed content to transform fitness training into a new experience. The company gathers extensive data and constantly analyzes it to implement improvements and enhance engagement while increasing barriers to switching and reducing customer churn. Peloton's reliance on software, data, and networks has enabled the company to scale fast, reaching over $700 million in revenue and a $4 billion valuation on an approximately $1 billion investment. The company's data stores provide it with a broad range of options to redefine what it means to be a fitness company. Online grocery delivery is one of the most challenging businesses, and it took many years for Ocado to win the respect of customers and competitors.

Ocado, a UK-based online grocer, has become successful by using AI, data, and robotics to optimize its supply chain operations. The company has a centralized data platform with detailed information on products, customers, partners, and delivery environment, which is used by agile teams to optimize various applications. AI algorithms are used for routing calculations, resulting in a highly predictable delivery model with a record of 98.5% on-time delivery. The company has built its capabilities over time and has become an AI company disguised as a supply chain company disguised as an online grocer.

Ocado's AI predicts when customers will order products and coordinates with organic farmers to pick up meats, poultry, and produce for storage in warehouses. The warehouses are equipped with thousands of bots managed by algorithms that prioritize deliveries while optimizing overall efficiency. The system is flexible and can expand to accommodate increasing capacity and locations. Although human labor is still used for certain tasks, Ocado's technology continues to innovate and collide with traditional operating processes.

Ocado, a UK-based online retailer with advanced AI and digital capabilities, is automating processes to improve scalability and reliability, and offering its technology platform to third-party retail and delivery services. Ocado is expanding globally, with partnerships in Canada and the US. Its focus on using digital technology to foster consumer loyalty and engagement is similar to other companies, including Ant Financial and Peloton, which are also transforming value delivery and driving industry transformation through innovative business models.

Ant Financial, Ocado, and Peloton have each transformed their industries through digitizing critical processes using algorithms and networks in unique ways. Ant Financial's impressive capabilities in analytics and AI drive scale and scope across financial services and beyond. Ocado's sophisticated AI algorithm enables scalability and innovation while integrating with human talent, and Peloton amplifies the impact of human talent through its network and community using data and analytics. Despite targeting different industries, each company emphasizes digitizing critical processes to sustain and enhance customer engagement and loyalty.

The integration of AI in business models removes traditional bottlenecks, enables scalability, and shifts growth bottlenecks to the technology layer. Google announced a shift from mobile-first to AI-first in 2017, placing AI at the core of its operating model and making it the common foundation across virtually every operating process.

Google's announcement of an AI-first approach in 2017 indicated that AI had become essential to the company's business and operating models, and would be the common foundation across virtually every operating process. This approach would increase the value of Google's products and services through conversational, ambient, and contextual AI, and continuously learn and adapt. It would also provide personalized and contextualized ads for advertisers. The announcement signaled the need for employees and partners to develop an in-depth understanding of AI and drive its application across every aspect of the company's value creation and operating model. The core of the firm, like Google's, is a scalable decision factory, powered by software, data, and algorithms.

The Industrial Revolution brought mass production to manufacturing, but traditional methods remained for analysis and decision making. The age of AI has brought a transformation of industrializing data gathering, analytics, and decision making in what is called the AI factory. Managerial decisions are digitized and enabled by the AI factory, which treats decision making as an industrial process. This results in the superior scale, scope, and learning capacity of the digital firm, and digital operating models take various forms.

The AI factory is at the core of the digital operating model of the 21st-century firm, guiding critical processes and operating decisions while humans are moved to the edge. The AI factory creates a virtuous cycle between user engagement, data collection, algorithm design, prediction, and improvement, refining and training a set of algorithms to improve their own accuracy. The predictions drive decisions and actions, either by informing human insights or by enabling an automated response, and hypotheses are tested through rigorous experimentation protocols. The example of a search engine demonstrates the multiple prediction cycles in an AI factory, improving predictions and increasing usage.

The search engine uses data on previous searches and automated auctions for relevant ads to shape the search results page. The product manager might have hypotheses for improving the page, which are tested on a sample of users using experimental machinery. The AI factory brings mass production methods to data processing and analytics. Netflix has an AI-centric operating model that influences every aspect of the business, from personalizing the user experience to negotiating content agreements.

Netflix recognized the importance of using data to improve the customer experience, focusing on developing a recommendation engine to suggest movies based on user history and preferences. With its streaming service, Netflix could track full user experience, including behavioral data to personalize recommendations and predict customer loyalty. Netflix uses data and AI algorithms to create content and personalize the user experience, resulting in 33 million different versions of Netflix for each user.

Netflix uses predictive analytics for audience sizing and personalized streaming experience. They embraced the AI factory approach and developed essential components such as data pipeline, algorithm development, experimentation platform, and software infrastructure. These components enable Netflix to have 150 million subscribers, a content library of 5,500 shows, and consume 15% of the global internet bandwidth.

AI systems require consistent and componentized infrastructure to embed the data pipeline and connect it to internal and external users. Data is the essential input of the AI factory, and Netflix uses a broad base of data inputs, such as item ratings, stream plays, metadata, and social data. The data pipeline includes inputs, processing, and safeguarding of data in a sustainable and scalable way. The experimentation platform tests new algorithms to ensure they have the intended effect.

Netflix collects and uses both internal and external data sources to personalize recommendations for its estimated 300 million users, including search terms, connected friends' activity, demographics, location, language, and temporal data. The company has approximately two thousand microclusters, or taste communities, which connect viewers with similar preferences. Netflix's datafication approach extracts data from ongoing activities and transactions to continuously improve the value provided to users.

The concept of datafication involves extracting data from ongoing activities and transactions to create new value. Companies like Nest, Oura, Uber, and Alipay have successfully created data layers around traditional activities such as controlling HVAC systems, sleep and health tracking, transportation, and economic transactions. The data generated by these companies is increasingly being combined with external data sources to provide additional value to users. To transform traditional activities into sources of useful data, innovation and investment in technology may be necessary.



 A provider of postal equipment in the US has built a datafication strategy around physical addresses and offers data-driven solutions for marketing, fraud detection, and other purposes to various organizations. 

 Many incumbent businesses attempting to build AI factories face challenges in cleaning and integrating their fragmented and siloed data. 

 Executives need to invest in ensuring data is accurate and consistent before integrating it.



 Data normalization is a challenge in integrating different types of data, especially financial data, for accurate analysis. 

 Algorithms are the tools that make data useful and involve predicting outcomes based on variables, calibrated with past data, and tested for accuracy before deployment. 

 Advances in AI algorithms have lowered the cost of making accurate predictions, increasing their scope and intensity throughout the economy.

AI algorithms can be used for various applications, from simple predictions to complex tasks exceeding human capabilities. Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are the three general approaches to develop accurate predictions using statistical models. Supervised learning aims to mimic a human expert in predicting an outcome using an expert-labeled dataset of potential characteristics or features. The operationalization of the algorithm is called a model. The foundations of algorithm design, including classic statistical models such as linear regression, date back over a hundred years.

In supervised learning, a labeled dataset is split between training and validation. The training dataset is used to determine the model's parameters that generate the prediction of the outcome. The validation dataset is used to test the model's accuracy, and the error rate between the model prediction and the expert prediction is compared. The main challenge is to keep iterating between data, features, and algorithms until the error rate is satisfactory. Supervised learning can predict either a binary outcome or a numerical quantity. Examples include spam detection in email and suggestion of friend names on Facebook.



Supervised machine learning relies on labeled data gathered from prior behaviors to create effective recommendations, and many companies may already have large datasets that are algorithm-ready. Examples of companies that could benefit from supervised machine learning include insurance companies and healthcare systems. 

Collaborative filtering algorithms, such as those used by Amazon and Airbnb, can be highly effective in making recommendations based on labeled datasets. 

Unsupervised learning algorithms, in contrast, are designed to discover insights in data with few preconceptions or known outcomes.



Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to find natural groupings in data without labels and can uncover structures that may not be obvious to the observer. 

Unsupervised learning is useful for gaining insights from social media postings, identifying customer groups, creating customer segments, and categorizing customer churn. 

National security agencies and law enforcement organizations also use unsupervised learning to accumulate and analyze huge amounts of data to identify abnormal patterns and potential security threats. 

In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms do not suggest specific labels but instead establish the most robust statistical groupings. Humans or other algorithms can then label the patterns and make decisions based on them.

There are three types of unsupervised learning: 1) clustering data into groups to understand customer segments, using examples like Netflix and topic modeling for text-based data 2) association rule mining to make product recommendations based on co-occurrence patterns, like Amazon and Ocado's discovery of a relationship between diapers and beer 3) anomaly detection to identify unusual observations.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that requires a starting point and a performance function, with a trade-off between exploring the complex world around us and exploiting the model we have built so far. It has potential for impactful applications. Anomaly detection, a type of unsupervised learning, is often used in fraud detection and maintenance of systems and machines.

Netflix uses a process of exploration and exploitation to maximize user engagement and improve its recommendation models. This process involves randomizing visuals shown to users to explore new possibilities and refine prediction models, and then exploiting the improved model to show users a slew of recommendations with improved visuals. This dynamic improvement process cycles between exploration and exploitation, which helps to learn the preferences of complex human beings. The approach is based on a common class of models used in reinforcement learning known as the multiarmed bandit problem, which involves allocating finite resources across different processes to maximize operating performance by minimizing regret.

Multiarmed bandit algorithms are used extensively in operating workflows to manage the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. These algorithms optimize the trade-offs between short-term impact and long-term improvement in real operating decisions. Reinforcement learning, which uses a predefined reward to maximize agent actions, has gained public attention with the development of AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, which have beaten master players at the ancient Chinese strategy game Go. These developments have led to a global race for world-class leadership in AI, with tremendous resources dedicated to achieving this goal.



 By providing rules to an AI system, it can learn to maximize rewards and outperform humans in certain tasks such as drug discovery and protein folding. 

 Google and LinkedIn run a large number of experiments each year to test potential improvements to their services, requiring a state-of-the-art experimentation platform to handle the scale. 

 Changes to the business must be formalized as a hypothesis and tested through randomized control trials to ensure causal effect on the outcome. 

 An experimentation platform is a necessary component of the AI factory to ensure that predictions generated by algorithms have a genuine impact on outcomes.



 Conducting A/B testing through experimentation platforms can provide statistically significant evidence on potential business improvements recommended by an AI factory at scale, without the need for expensive rebates to millions of customers. 

 Netflix has built an extensive experimentation platform integrated within its algorithm development and execution process to improve product changes, video streaming, content delivery network algorithms, image selection, user interface changes, email campaigns, playback, and registration. 

 The fully automated experimentation platform enables Netflix employees to run experiments at scale and bring scientific rigor to decision making. 

 The data pipeline, algorithm design and execution engine, and experimentation platform should all be embedded in software infrastructure to drive the operating activities of a digital firm.

A data platform uses a publish-subscribe methodology for APIs to provide clean, consistent data to applications, enabling agile development and deployment of AI applications. Strategic investments in connectivity and infrastructure are necessary to integrate with the data platform, and organizations should avoid siloed structures and instead design clear interfaces to enable decentralized innovation at the module level. The goal is to build thousands of AI applications for different types of predictions.

Clear and secure APIs are essential for a consistent and agile data platform, especially when sharing data with external partners, as seen in the example of Taobao. APIs compartmentalize the innovation problem and enable independent agile teams to focus on specific tasks. A well-designed data platform improves an organization's ability to focus on data governance and security, which is crucial given the sensitivity and value of the massive amount of data captured. A secure, centralized system is necessary to carefully manage and protect data and provide appropriate checks and balances on access and usage.

Defining clear and secure APIs is crucial for AI factories as they control data flow and access to critical assets. The infrastructure of an AI factory must be secure, robust, and scalable, preferably on the cloud and seamlessly connected to the company's operating model. The development of an AI system by the Laboratory of Innovation Science at Harvard demonstrates that building an AI factory is not limited to big companies like Netflix.

The Laboratory of Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH) developed an AI system that can outline the shape of lung cancer tumors in CT image scans as accurately as a Harvard-trained radiation oncologist. The system was created using LISH's AI factory and data from 461 patients, with algorithm design contests on Topcoder. The top five algorithms used convolutional neural networks and random forest algorithms, and none of the contestants had prior experience with medical imaging or cancer diagnostics.



 The article discusses the use of custom and published AI architectures for object detection and localization, citing an example of algorithms performing better than existing commercial software in a cancer analysis contest. 

 The authors emphasize that constructing an AI factory does not necessarily require vast resources, and highlight the importance of considering a firm's operating architecture when implementing AI in larger organizations. 

 The next chapter of the article focuses on the strategic considerations involved in rearchitecting a firm, with reference to Jeff Bezos' mandate that all teams should expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.



 The text discusses an email from Jeff Bezos in 2002, in which he mandated that all communication between teams at Amazon must be via service interface calls over the network, with no exceptions. 

 This was a pivotal moment in the digital transformation of business, with the twenty-first-century firm requiring a fundamentally different business and operating foundation, based on an integrated, highly modular digital infrastructure. 

 The focus is on being architected differently, rather than just leveraging technology or being a digital native, with a move away from siloed organizational processes towards a more integrated approach.

Software has become the core operating system of firms, replacing traditional labor and asset-intensive models, generating increasing returns to scale, scope, and learning. To sustain growth, a digital firm requires a different kind of operating model, architected to take an integrated core of software, data, and AI. The organization reflects the system, and the system reflects the organization, which has important implications for the evolution of firms. In 1967, computer scientist Melvin Conway noted that an organization is constrained to design systems that reflect its communication patterns.

Conway's law states that for an integrated technology component to be designed properly, its designers must communicate frequently, which implies that interrelated tasks are best performed by integrated teams. The mirroring hypothesis states that organizational ties within a project will correspond to the technical patterns of dependency in the work being performed. The architecture of systems mirrors the architecture of the organizations that depend on them, and these mutually reinforcing connections can become a significant asset for a firm, enhancing quality and efficiency. Over time, these patterns can also constrain an organization, building inertia that hampers the response to change. Architectural innovations can require changing the architecture between technological components, which can break down the mirroring between organization and technology.

The concept of architectural inertia, which refers to established organizations' resistance to change, has been a particular danger for firms in the face of disruptive innovation. This makes it difficult to achieve transformations that require organizing work in new ways, particularly in enterprise information technology, which has been largely deployed along traditional operating and organizational boundaries. Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, aimed to break this inertia by transforming both the technology and organization of Amazon.

Firms evolved into siloed operating architectures consisting of specialized, largely autonomous functions and operating units dating back to at least the Italian Renaissance. This operating model managed operational complexity by breaking an organization into smaller, separate units, each focused on an individual task and discipline. Amazon aims to build a software-, data-, and AI-driven firm and break away from traditional operating architectures. The Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602, may have been the first modern corporation to achieve economies of scale by integrating various shipping portfolios and managing risk.

The company achieved success by subdividing into specialized and autonomous units to manage multinational operations. They dominated global trade using traditional craft methods but the Industrial Revolution led to the emergence of mass production, which increased specialization and standardization. This approach led to further subdivision within the organization based on the nature of work.

The Ford Motor Company revolutionized manufacturing by introducing the first moving assembly line, which cut assembly time and reduced costs, making cars affordable to the middle-class. This unprecedented level of standardization and specialization in their operating model broke down functional specialties and organizational silos to the smallest, most specialized, standardized human tasks.



General Motors broke down organizational silos not only by narrowly defined function but also by product, creating autonomous product units that focused on different product lines. 

The Toyota TPS operating model added a dedication to learning and problem-solving at all levels of the organization, pushing back on traditional narrow specialization in the industry. 

Mass production took off rapidly in most other manufacturing industries in the US and Europe, as workers and organizations specialized, generating increasing economies of scale and efficiencies that wiped out traditional crafts in a broad range of industries.



Specialization, focus, and standardization were key concepts of mass production which spread across various industries, including services like supermarkets, fast food franchises, hotels, banks, hospitals, and airlines. 

Highly specialized, siloed operating models remain essential in modern manufacturing and service delivery, as evidenced by Foxconn's facilities in China, which can produce over 500,000 iPhones a day by narrowly specialized, optimized work. 

Deployment of enterprise IT did not transform the trajectory of operating models, as IT systems generally mirrored siloed and specialized firms.

The architecture of many major enterprises remains siloed and distributed, with processes, software applications, and data embedded in autonomous organizational units. Integrating data across these silos is a complicated and unreliable process, requiring significant investment and custom code. Traditional operating models have led to great success but also created constraints to firm growth and value, eventually outpacing the capacity of every organization and opening opportunities for competition.

Traditional organizations suffer from diseconomies of scale, scope, and learning as they grow, leading to inefficiency and even failure. Traditional information technology has not significantly loosened these constraints. Integrating and aggregating various applications and connecting potentially valuable data is a long and painful endeavor, as disparate disconnected legacy systems need to be pieced together through custom software. Firms are shaped and limited by their operating models, which help manage complexity.

The traditional firm structure and operating models have limitations in scalability, scope, and learning despite widespread improvements in management and operations and the use of enterprise IT. Amazon faced similar challenges and needed a major architectural change, which Jeff Bezos realized would involve breaking organizational and technological silos and rearchitecting tasks, starting with software, to build a software- and data-driven operating model that could expand the company's retail operations to unprecedented levels of scale, scope, and learning. The progress of this transformation is depicted in Figure 4-3, which traces the Amazon timeline.

Jeff Bezos rearchitected Amazon's technology and organization at the same time, rebuilding the retail operation on a software platform and transforming the organization with agile teams working within established interfaces. The platform was redesigned multiple times, with Brian Valentine, a software platform leader, overseeing the creation of a centralized, standardized set of services and clear APIs. This shift required Amazon to rewrite virtually all of its e-commerce services, and the new platform took longer to build and implement than originally expected. The redesign of the retail platform led to a modular, distributed development structure with a common foundation in the Santana technology.

Amazon's organizational structure enables small teams to work independently while sharing common code and data. They have become a leader in deploying AI across their enterprise through the use of their cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offers an AI toolkit and software toolkit called SageMaker. Large organizations and startups have started to deploy AI tools on their own problems with AWS's AI offerings. Amazon has become an expert in deploying the latest AI advances across all aspects of its business and has become a powerhouse in AI. Their internal machine learning conference has grown significantly as a result.

Amazon is leading a trend of AI-driven firms that aggregate software, data, and analytics, posing a threat to traditional firms. The operating model of these firms departs from traditional corporate evolution and exhibits a different architecture. A digital system or agent can communicate at zero marginal cost, connect with complementary activities, and embed processing instructions to execute logic and learn as they process data. These digital agents can connect and combine capabilities, enriching the range of possibilities.

Digital operating architectures benefit from unlimited connectivity and data aggregation, and should be designed to unleash the potential of the digital technology they are built on. The ideal model involves a common foundation of data inputs, software technology, and algorithms provided by an AI factory, with small, agile teams developing individual applications. Modern operating models are focused on improving performance through learning, with real-time fine-tuning of algorithms and dedicated experimentation platforms. Employees engage in hundreds or thousands of A/B tests daily.

In a digital operating model, experimentation is decentralized, and modularity and software reuse are promoted. The focus is on shared development and open source software, and removing human interaction from the critical path transforms the growth process by removing operating bottlenecks. Algorithm-driven operating models are almost infinitely scalable, as the marginal cost of serving an additional user by digital agents becomes negligible. Operational complexity is solved through software and analytics or outsourced to the external nodes of the firm's operating network.

Digitization of processes can greatly increase the scope of operation by enabling modular connections to external networks, leading to a multiplicative factor in delivering value. Learning effects and increasing returns to scale from data accumulation can significantly enhance the value created by AI and ML. This new organizational model transforms the role of management, making them designers, innovators, and integrators of digital systems that deliver value to customers.

In an AI-centered operating model, managers must connect digital systems, identify new connections, and guard against quality, reliability, security, and responsibility issues. Traditional firms may hesitate to embrace AI-powered architectures due to the challenge of organizational transformation. Satya Nadella's approach to balance conviction with patience is an example of what it takes to become an AI company.

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, led the company's transformation into a cloud software company, which tripled the company's stock price in the first three years of his tenure. He then announced plans for Microsoft's next transformation focused on the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, which would enable the company to create richer experiences for customers and partners. Nadella emphasized the responsibility to ensure the benefits of technology reach people broadly across society and that the technologies created are trusted by individuals and organizations.

Technology companies, including Microsoft, have undergone major transformations in both operating model and business model to become software-based, AI-driven organizations. Ongoing transformation is becoming necessary for all companies, not just tech firms. To transform into an AI company, a data-centric operating architecture and agile organization are necessary. Microsoft's transformation involved changes in both business and operating models, and five key principles can be drawn from their process. Other companies, including Fidelity Investments, have also undergone successful transformations.

Microsoft, after facing various competitive threats and antitrust scrutiny, had lost its way and its relevance with the software community. Under Steve Ballmer's leadership, there was a lack of innovation, and the company faced numerous setbacks. Microsoft's ecosystem of developers, which was central to its success, had shrunk, and it was no longer the platform of choice. Satya Nadella understood that the company needed a new mission and strategy that would renew its sense of purpose and identity. He went back to the company's origin to frame Microsoft's new mission and strategy as a technology company focused on driving innovation.

Microsoft's new mission is to empower every person and organization to achieve more, and its new strategy is to become the productivity platform for the age of AI. This involves a shift towards a services-based consumption orientation, backed by a cloud-based architecture and AI capabilities. To become a leading cloud provider, Microsoft embraced open source and invested heavily in open source projects, contributing much of its own software to the open domain. The acquisition of GitHub in 2018 helped Microsoft have an impact at the center of the open source community.



 Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, implemented a new strategy focused on cloud and AI, resulting in significant transitions and the departure of experienced leaders. The remaining team, along with new hires and promotions, developed a laser focus on the strategy. Microsoft invested heavily in infrastructure and supply chain to compete with Amazon, resulting in years of work and significant losses, but eventually paid off. The company spent billions annually in building their cloud and has a laser focus on the importance of the cloud and AI.



 Cloud-based architectures offer operational benefits such as real-time information on supply chain problems, improved services based on customer feedback, and analytics opportunities. Customer alignment and consumption data are crucial for cloud providers like Microsoft to track product improvements. Microsoft's data platforms integrate and process consumption data to enable increasingly powerful analytics and generate essential improvements. The responsibility is significant, as cloud providers become part of their customers' operations, from elections to mission-critical systems in airline operations. Prior to Satya Nadella's promotion, Azure had been run as a separate, autonomous organization, causing challenges for Microsoft, but the company later transformed its core and integrated Azure with other product lines.

Satya Nadella brought Azure to the center of Microsoft and transformed its core by making it easier to use and compatible with traditional Microsoft products. Scott Guthrie, an engineering leader, made it his mission to make the platform more user-friendly and easier to deploy with Microsoft's traditional customers. Guthrie succeeded Laing in running the Azure business and transformed its structure, processes, and value system to make it increasingly powerful and business-friendly. Azure was redesigned to run Windows and Linux workloads, and substantial incentives were added for customers to move their applications to Azure. The key to changing Microsoft's core was the transformation of Microsoft's own installed base of customers.

Microsoft integrated Azure software and hardware engineering under cohesive, business-focused goals and agile methods, with an emphasis on improving responsiveness to operations. Microsoft entered its second transformation by layering sophisticated machine learning and AI capabilities across its operational infrastructure, led by the Cloud and AI group under Scott Guthrie and the Experiences and Devices group under Rajesh Jha. The company had been building a strong AI capability since the early 2000s, and the Nadella announcement accelerated AI technology development and product introductions.

Microsoft's AI strategy centers around its developer ecosystem and the accessibility of Azure infrastructure. The company has introduced a range of AI-driven services and Azure Data Factory for data integration. The internal transformation required to implement these changes was led by Kurt DelBene, who reshaped Microsoft's data assets, IT, and operations teams. Microsoft's IT and operations had previously been reactive, but with the focus on digital technology, the company had to make changes to become more proactive.

To build and automate critical operating tasks, Microsoft had to transform its IT to a proactive mode and integrate it with operations and strategy. Under DelBene, Microsoft's IT became Core Services Engineering, led by a clear vision of success and a product development team approach. The organization reduced its reliance on outsourcing, gained budget responsibility, and hired engineers from product groups to build a new development culture. Microsoft can now identify all its data and use AI and machine learning models to preempt issues like bad contracts and cyber breaches.

Microsoft's Core Services is a horizontal platform that provides components to build processes across the entire company, breaking down silos and enabling co-development engagements with product teams. It is at the center of Microsoft's transformation to rebuild traditional silos on a common digital foundation and connect the organization to a common software component library, algorithm repository, and data catalog. This technology stack has become the foundation of Microsoft's operating model and governance includes confronting broader implications of AI.

Microsoft's president and general counsel, Brad Smith, works with the company's research team and the Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs (CELA) department to set policies and strategies for AI. After an offensive incident with an AI-powered chat bot, Microsoft created clear guidelines for designing responsible bots and identified six AI principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. The policies are integrated into a variety of activities from development to sales, and CELA's efforts address fundamental issues of privacy, security, accessibility, sustainability, and digital inclusion.

The article discusses the importance of digital transformation for enterprises and provides five guiding principles for an effective transformation process. The first principle is to have strategic clarity and commitment from leadership. The transformation should aim to bring unity to the company while changing its operating model. The process requires an integrated approach across various departments. Many traditional enterprises have already made significant progress in digitizing and developing AI capabilities.

The article emphasizes the importance of cross-functional collaboration and coordination to successfully transform a company's operating model to focus on data, analytics, and AI. The technical goals of the transformation must be clearly communicated to all stakeholders to achieve an integrated data platform that ensures privacy and security. Standard policies, components, and architecture are critical for deploying sophisticated AI. The combination of networks, analytics, and AI can lead to dramatic business model innovation and expansion, as seen in Microsoft's cloud and AI orientation.



IT organizations often resist transformation efforts due to their traditional charters and skill sets, as well as being rewarded for working within existing company silos.

 

Developing a product-focused mentality is essential for building an AI-centric operating model.

 

Agile methods are key to a transformed, data-centric operating architecture, which enables quick application development.





Transforming an organization to an AI-centered operating model requires a cultural shift towards a software mindset and changing traditional practices.

 

Building a foundation of capability in software, data sciences, and advanced analytics is a significant challenge, but can be done with motivated people and the right process and incentives.

 

Hiring and grooming data and analytics product managers with business backgrounds and experiences is important for identifying important use cases and leading teams in developing new applications.



The increasing importance of AI in firms creates challenges that require a clear and multidisciplinary governance approach to avoid unintended consequences and catastrophic failure. Digital governance should involve collaboration across disciplines and functions, rejuvenating the role of legal and corporate affairs. Firms should actively staff and support legal and ethical exposure activities. In addition, firms should engage with their ecosystem of partners, customers, and communities to build a strong governance process. Microsoft's appetite for digital transformation is not unusual, and analytics and AI capabilities in firms require deeper thinking and research.

A systematic study of over 350 enterprises assessed their data, analytics, and AI capabilities and correlated the results with business performance, showing that firms with deployed analytics and AI capabilities enjoyed superior business performance. The research focused on manufacturing and service sectors, with major firms represented in consumer packaged goods, financial services, and retail. An AI maturity index was developed, revealing important differences among firms with traditional and rudimentary means at the bottom and sophisticated firms at the top leveraging AI and ML for operational automation and business insights. The benefits of an AI-enabled operating model were demonstrated through the research.



 Leaders benefited from data and analytics investments in various business functions, using data to automate decisions and aid in making complex decisions. 

 Top organizations consolidated data to develop a single version of truth and used analytical models to tailor customer experiences, mitigate customer churn, and enable real-time process decisions. 

 Leading firms used data to better understand the market, acquire new customers, and optimize advertising effectiveness. 

 The best firms used data and analytics across engineering, manufacturing, and operations, consolidating information across the product development life cycle and supply chain to drive process compliance and improvement. 

 Internet of Things (IoT) technologies were used to optimize manufacturing and service operations and transform value delivery and capture.



 Best-performing companies invest heavily in developing data, analytics, and AI-centered capabilities, driving a change in their operating models and cultural shift to fully embrace AI opportunities and challenges. 

 There is a natural sequence of stages in the journey to become a state-of-the-art AI factory, starting from siloed data to pilots, data hubs, and AI factories. 

 Companies use data to develop forecasts and recommendations across various functions, from optimizing business strategy to automating employee development plans. 

 Investment in AI capability is shown to have a positive financial impact, with leaders in AI maturity index demonstrating higher gross margin, earnings before taxes, and net income compared to laggards.

The transformation of a company's digital operating model involves four stages. The adoption of a single source of truth and a centralized data sciences team is crucial. Going from a data hub to an AI factory requires a major investment and an emphasis on clear policies and governance. Building AI skills and capabilities across the organization is an ongoing journey.

Fidelity Investments underwent an AI transformation, beginning with the establishment of an AI Center of Excellence and a list of key AI initiatives and goals. The company hired top data scientists, expanded recruitment efforts, and encouraged the emergence of data- and AI-focused product management. Fidelity made AI an essential part of every facet of the business and built it as a core capability.



 Fidelity centralized its strategic analytics data assets to create a 360-degree view of the customer and assembled its own analytics software stack. 

 The data platform integrated over 36 million user profiles, interactions, and voice calls to mine customer insights, improve services, and provide more value to clients. 

 Organizational and cultural shifts were made toward adopting agile methods for faster decision-making and deployment of new applications. 

 Mayar launched an education effort to drive AI capability across the firm. 

 Fidelity's AI efforts prioritize customer experience, personalized investment strategies, and risk management.



 Fidelity's investments focus on revenue growth, optimizing operating processes, scalability, new opportunities, and generating business insights using data and AI. 

 Fidelity is driving a data- and AI-centric operating model across its multiple lines of business, with dedicated investments in governance, cybersecurity, and privacy. 

 Many firms are engaged in operating model transformation, driving new capabilities, improving performance, and powering new business opportunities. 

 As digital transformation reshapes the economy, firms need a new way to approach strategy to shape their business models.

As digital connections transform industries and create new sources of competitive advantage, firms need to evaluate their options through a new lens. The strategic dynamics of AI and networks go hand in hand, leading to the emergence of more connected and powerful firms. The architecture of the economy is being reconfigured into a huge, AI-powered network consisting of various subnetworks. The challenge of operating model transformation has implications for strategy and business model transformation.

Digital networks, powered by software algorithms, are becoming increasingly important to the economy and social system. Competitive advantage now depends on the ability to shape and control these networks and extract value from the data they carry through powerful analytics and AI. Companies that connect businesses and accumulate data are becoming more central and competitive. Strategic analysis should focus on the connections a firm creates across industries and the flows of data through the networks it connects to, rather than specific industry segments. Network analysis will shape strategic thinking in the future.

The text provides guidance on conducting network analysis in the context of new strategic considerations for business. It explores the critical interactions between a business and the rest of the economy and how networks around a business can shape the dynamics of value creation and capture. The chapter uses an example to present a systematic analysis of an existing business and concludes with summarizing the key implications of network analysis for business strategy. The new strategic problem involves understanding the open and distributed connections across firms, with each firm connected to a large number of networks across disparate industries. Firms accumulate network and learning effects as they link to each other and to different networks.

The text discusses the value of network and learning effects in creating and capturing value for businesses. It presents a figure that illustrates the value created by businesses as a function of scale and shows how the value curve can change shape as the impact of network and learning effects increases. The text emphasizes the importance of increasing the value created at scale to gain a competitive advantage and provides an example from the healthcare sector.



 Network analysis involves mapping economic networks and identifying opportunities to gain advantage through AI. 

 A pharmaceutical company leveraged digital networks to expand the reach of its new drug for managing Parkinson's disease through an app designed for patients to use at home. 

 The app captured valuable data that could be used to optimize treatment and create connections among patients and service providers. 

 Strategic analysis should consider the full range of network interactions to discover potential complementary uses. 

 The connections made through the app can provide synergies with the company's core business of pharmaceuticals.



 Enabling patient-to-patient interactions through the app can deepen loyalty and gather valuable data, while connecting with insurers and health providers can amplify the impact of data-driven insights. 

 Opportunities for monetization from insurance providers and advertisers can increase the value curve. 

 To understand the possibilities, networks should be analyzed separately and then the interactions and potential synergies across networks should be examined. 

 The analysis focuses on how network structure impacts the dynamics of value creation and capture, with factors influencing each discussed separately before summarizing interactions.

A digital operating model's network effects create value as more users utilize a product or service. The value of a social media platform or messaging service depends on the number of users. Network effects do not typically occur with traditional products, as their value is fixed. The value increase in a network is subject to debate and can be modeled as a linear function of the number of users or more complex functions.

The underlying value of a pen remains the same, while a fax machine exhibits network effects. Network effects occur when the value of a product or service increases as the number of users increases. Direct network effects occur when users value the presence of other users, while indirect network effects occur when users in one category value the presence of users in another category. Platforms hosting networks enable matches between users and capture the value generated by network effects. Examples of networks that exhibit indirect network effects include Uber, Airbnb, YouTube, and gaming console platforms.

Network effects can be one-sided and companies can leverage one type of network effect to generate the other type. The relationship between network scale and value is complex, and the extent to which networks can increase in value as they grow differs widely. Businesses relying on weak network effects have less sustainable advantages in the long term. Premium content streaming businesses like Netflix can reach value quickly.

Netflix's network effects weaken over time as competitors can follow the same path without much disadvantage. YouTube enjoys stronger network effects as independent content producers have little incentive to post on other sites. Businesses with strong network effects have fewer competitors and a more substantial competitive advantage. Learning effects add value to existing network effects or generate value in their own right. Google's search business benefits from learning effects, which improve the service. Bing's partnership with Yahoo! failed to compete with Google's search advertising business because it did not benefit from the same learning effects.



Learning effects that depend on scale can reinforce competitive advantage and lead to higher monetization. 

The accuracy of most algorithms improves with the size of the dataset, and the impact of scale and scope on the value created by a firm amplifies as operating models incorporate multiple algorithms. 

The enduring impact of data on competitive advantage varies depending on the type of algorithm and the uniqueness and scale of the data required. 

For relatively simple algorithms, the required data size may be small, but for more complex problems, a larger dataset is needed to train and optimize the algorithm.



The defensibility of a business's competitive advantage depends on the uniqueness and scale of the data required to train the algorithm. 

The larger a network, the greater the value of the connections, flow of data, and opportunities for AI and overall learning, and any connection in a network can be a useful source of data. 

The structure of the network, including clustering, has an important impact on how a network's value increases with its size. 

In network-based business models, clustering can make a big difference, and for global services like Airbnb, any serious challenger would have to enter the market on a global scale.

Creating global brand awareness is crucial for success in the home-sharing market, where entry barriers are high and sustaining profitability is relatively easy for the dominant player. Global networks are more concentrated around critical hubs and barriers to competition are high. Marriott's entry into the market will provide insights into how well incumbents can compete with Airbnb and HomeAway. In contrast to Airbnb's network, Uber's network is highly clustered, and the impact of scale and network effects is lower, making it easier for competitors to enter. Clustered networks are typically highly competitive, and any competitor with local scale can achieve similar efficiencies.

Uber faces competition from both national and local competitors in major cities, such as Gett, Juno, and Via in New York. Clustered networks are not limited to ride-sharing and can be observed in group buying, food delivery, medical networks, and sports networks. Firms involved in clustered networks are vulnerable to competition from focused competitors specializing in a given cluster, region, or specialty. Geographic differences usually limit the value of aggregation across locations. The strength and structure of network and learning effects can change over time, making markets more or less competitive.



 Windows-based network effects were strong with around 6 million dedicated developers, making it difficult for app developers to work with non-Microsoft platforms. However, as internet-based applications and services took off, most functionality moved away from PC applications to web-based and mobile applications. This resulted in decreased concentration in affected markets as the strength of the network effect decreased. 

 Options for value capture have grown dramatically due to the ease with which digital networks can connect various types of users and businesses. Digital value capture technologies allow for careful usage metering and sophisticated pricing algorithms.



 Digital business networks have various options for value capture, including adjusting pricing to charge the side or network having the least competition and the greatest willingness to pay. Network effects open new types of value capture options, and companies with two-sided indirect network effects have more options for value capture. 

 Multihoming, or using multiple platforms simultaneously, can impact value capture strategies. Companies like Alibaba and Amazon have found that advertising fees from merchants are a lucrative revenue source above and beyond the transaction fees they collect.



Multihoming, or the ability of users to connect with multiple platforms or hub firms, challenges the value capture of network hubs facing competition from other hubs. 

If multihoming is common on both sides of a platform, it becomes almost impossible for the platform to generate profits. 

Examples of multihoming include smartphone app developers using both iOS and Android, and ride-hailing drivers and riders using multiple platforms to compare prices and reduce idle time. 

Home-sharing sites like Airbnb also experience serious multihoming on both sides of their platform, with homeowners listing properties on multiple sites and renters searching all available sites.



Multihoming hinders profitability in ride- and home-sharing services. 

Platform owners attempt to reduce multihoming by locking in one side of the market and offering exclusive benefits to power users. 

Uber and Lyft offer incentives to drivers to become exclusive, and both companies provide usage-based rewards programs for their riders. 

Video game console makers have signed exclusive contracts with game publishers, and Amazon charges higher fees to third-party sellers who don't sell exclusively on its platform.

To retain customers and reduce their tendency to use multiple services, a subscription service for free two-day shipping has been implemented by a company. Disintermediation is a significant problem for capturing value in marketplaces as nodes can easily bypass the firm to connect directly. Hubs may facilitate transactions by providing insurance, payment escrow, communication tools, resolving disputes, or monitoring transactions to enhance the value for users of conducting business through the hub. However, disintermediation can still occur, and strategies to deter it such as requiring users to conduct all transactions on the platform or blocking users from exchanging contact information may not always be effective.

A study found that as trust between clients and freelancers improved on an online freelance marketplace, more disintermediation occurred, offsetting revenue gains. Reducing transaction fees and providing complementary services can be more effective in reducing disintermediation. Network bridging, which involves making connections with external networks, can improve a firm's business model. The Chinese outsourcing marketplace ZBJ reduced transaction fees and offered complementary services, such as trademark registration, becoming the largest service provider in China and valued at over $2 billion.



 Connecting previously separate economic networks can create new synergies and improve the ability to create and capture value. 

 Google's bridging of the search business with advertisers is a classic example of this. 

 Access to users and data has made investment in payment networks worthwhile. 

 Data-based assets are useful across multiple network sides, allowing hub firms like Amazon and Alibaba to move into different markets. 

 Alibaba bridged e-commerce platforms with financial services using its payment network, Alipay, and leveraged transaction data to offer credit systems with low default rates. 

 Bridging different networks can mutually reinforce market positions and help create new opportunities for value creation and capture.



 Alibaba's Alipay remains successful in part due to its tight bridging with other Alibaba services. 

 Successful network hubs can drive connections across previously disconnected industries. 

 Strategic network analysis involves listing the major networks a business is connected to, such as riders and drivers for Uber. 

 Evaluation of each major network's potential for value creation and capture at scale is necessary in strategic network analysis. 

 Uber has expanded its networks to include food providers, healthcare providers, and other organizations for increased value creation and capture opportunities.

This text evaluates Uber's strategic networks using a checklist of network properties that can strengthen or weaken value creation and capture. Uber's main businesses do not have direct network effects and are geographically clustered, making it vulnerable to low-cost competitors. However, it benefits from important learning effects and extensive data analysis. The checklist shows that Uber has no synergies with other networks, extensive multihoming, and extensive disintermediation.

Despite extensive multi-homing and clustering leading to intense competition and uncertain profitability, Uber shows promise in connecting to additional networks to capture value. Ubers future profitability will depend on bridging highly engaged riders and drivers to additional networks, which can enable the company's long-term viability. Uber has opportunities for bridging enabled by the intrinsic value of its core service, and as long as intrinsic value is present, Uber can find ways to bridge the business and generate revenue.

Uber is exploring bridging opportunities to connect its driver network with other business networks, such as grocery delivery, Uber Eats, and Uber Health. These opportunities depend on profitable deals with providers and face competition and clustering challenges. UberPool adds direct network effects to its traditional indirect network effects business, making it less likely for competitors to offer similar services.

Uber's potential for profitability through bridging opportunities is uncertain, but UberPool's direct network effects could make it a profitable contender in the future. Cargo offers a way for drivers to make extra profit by selling products to riders. The intrinsic value of Uber offers numerous bridging opportunities, but achieving a stable valuation as a public company will require work. Entrepreneurs and executives should ask what their business's core service is to develop strategies and envision potential value creation and capture opportunities in the networks they could connect to.

The effectiveness of Parkinson's disease treatment can be improved by monitoring daily progress through patient data. The patient network is crucial for the app's success and has strong learning effects, which will become increasingly useful at scale. To strengthen network and learning effects over time, additional functionality could be added to the app to encourage interaction among participants, leading to mutual support and advice exchange.

The article discusses the challenge of building a business that relies on strong network effects. To overcome the "chicken-and-egg" problem, companies can try various tactics such as loading the app with content, providing treatment advice, and gamifying the experience. The article also emphasizes the importance of analyzing secondary networks and identifies several networks that would benefit the Parkinsons app, including physicians, researchers, insurers, and pharmacies. These networks could help improve the app's competitive position and sustainability.



 The Parkinsons app business is limited by its inherent clustering on Parkinsons patients, but can deliver daily value when it plugs into related networks. 

 Value capture opportunities exist for patients, physicians, researchers, and insurers, but critical mass is necessary for significant value creation due to strong learning and network effects. 

 Strategy should not charge patients or physicians, but consider providing the app for free and monetizing through increased branding and exposure to the complementary pharmaceutical business, targeted ads, physician referrals, insurance subsidies, and anonymized data monetization opportunities.



 Parkinson's app may have network bridging opportunities with insurers and other healthcare providers to enable bridging into other disease networks. 

 Digitizing key elements of the operating model can open new strategic options and transform value creation and capture. 

 Collisions occur when firms with digital operating models target applications traditionally served by more conventional firms, and can completely transform industries and reshape the nature of competition.

Traditional operating models can generate economic value faster than digital operating models at first, causing skepticism from executives. However, once the digital model scales, it can deliver impressive value and overwhelm traditional firms. The collision between digital and traditional firms is felt across various industries, such as the travel industry where Airbnb's lean and agile organization is challenging the traditional model of hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton. Airbnb's digitally tracked and managed community of property owners and AI algorithms generate network and learning effects, while Marriott's growth is limited by its traditional operational constraints. In just a decade, Airbnb has scaled to offer three times the inventory of Marriott and Hilton combined.

Airbnb has achieved impressive lodging capacity in just a decade, utilizing a data-centric operating model with AI and machine learning. It expands its scope to offer a variety of experiences, driving network and learning effects for value creation and capture. Booking Holdings is another formidable force, with a similar data-centric model offering 30 million listings. The industry is transforming rapidly with increased market concentration and M&A activity, and Marriott has responded by merging with Starwood to exploit synergies across loyalty programs and data assets.

Marriott is working to compete against digital travel companies like Airbnb and Booking, which have digitized critical tasks and added a software layer to the industry. These companies leverage network and learning effects to scale and improve operational decisions, accumulating data on user behavior to better satisfy traveler needs. The collision between traditional and digital travel companies highlights the importance of adapting to changing market needs and adopting digital operating models.

Data is used by algorithms to prioritize content and engage users, amplifying the impact of network and learning effects in a self-reinforcing loop. As digital operating models accumulate more data and connections, the value delivered increases, making it harder for traditional models to compete. The advantages of scale become insurmountable, and new companies must offer innovative solutions to compete. The value delivered will continue to increase at an increasing rate as network and learning effects drive growth.

The increasing importance of network and learning effects, coupled with digital operating models, is leading to market concentration and making it difficult for traditional companies to compete. This is evident in the travel industry, where profits are moving to the operating system layer. The upcoming decade will witness a fierce battle for control of the global travel market. The collapse of Nokia, despite being an industry leader in mobile communications, serves as an example of how digital disruption can quickly render traditional companies irrelevant.

Nokia was a renowned product company with a focus on user needs and efficient manufacturing processes. However, its reliance on a siloed, geographically separated structure, dedicated product teams, and multiple R&D centers led to a lack of digital consistency. Although Nokia invested in the Symbian operating system, its software was fine-tuned to different designs and features, making it difficult for developers to create apps. The opening of an app store (Ovi) in 2008 failed to attract developers due to the inconsistency of Nokia's software.

Nokia failed to benefit from a digital foundation, platform ecosystem, and consistent data architecture, while Apple's iOS and Google's Android built on a consistent digital platform that attracted a diverse set of OEMs, app developers, and service providers. The iOS and Android platforms encouraged the formation of large networks of app developers, spurring intense developer excitement, user engagement, and the flow of data and value to developers and advertisers, increasing the value of iOS and Android rapidly.

The collision of iPhone and Android smartphones dramatically changed the industry structure, migrating profits from hardware to software layer through complementary revenue sources. Nokia, BlackBerry, Sony Ericsson, and Motorola fell off the map. Nokia invested in R&D but failed to build a digital operating model like iOS and Android, which became magnets for app developers and advertisers, rapidly growing to dominate markets and transform the economy. All in all, it took less than five years for Nokia to discover the importance of digital network businesses reaching critical mass.

The article discusses Nokia's failure to adapt to the smartphone market by standardizing on a digital framework or acknowledging the dominance of smartphone OS companies. Nokia's CEO committed to Windows mobile operating system despite its low market share, leading to the company's demise. The article suggests that other industries may face similar challenges from disruptors such as Airbnb and Booking.

The article discusses the collision between traditional firms and highly scalable, data-driven, software-centric operating models across various industries, such as computing, retail, pay TV, and finance. These disruptors leverage networks, data, and AI to drive personalization and expand services, changing the competitive dynamics and market structure. The article explores examples of past and present collisions in the computing sector, where digital platforms with separate, modular operating systems revolutionized the industry value chain.

The dominance of Windows in PC operating systems peaked at more than 90 percent due to a strong developer ecosystem and network effects. Google's increasing dominance in smartphones follows a similar playbook with the addition of data, AI, and advertising services. Cloud computing has digitized the process of software distribution, offering a new business and operating model for computing services. Microsoft is back in the game after losing out to open source alternatives, and is making inroads in transforming business and operating models to offer cloud services optimized for business applications. Amazon and Microsoft now alternate as the world's most valuable company in this collision-prone industry.

The operating architecture of firms in the technology industry is less siloed and fragmented, making it easier to transform and adopt new generations of technology. Early e-tailer models digitized buying transactions, but online retailers like Amazon evolved into digital retail platforms, rearchitecting their operating models to aggregate data and share software components. Traditional retailers initially withstood the first generation of online retailers, but Amazon's data-centric, software-based operating model, which was emulated by other companies, posed a bigger threat. The transformation called for a fundamentally different operating model.

The retail and entertainment industries have undergone significant transformation due to the adoption of data- and software-centric operating models. This has allowed for personalized retail experiences both online and offline, and has enabled retail supply chains to become more efficient. The success of Napster in the late 1990s paved the way for other music distribution companies such as Apple Music and Spotify, which transformed the industry. Similarly, the launch of RealNetworks in 1997 revolutionized internet streaming video, but the company faced competition due to its server software business model.

The streaming industry has been revolutionized by companies like YouTube and Netflix, which offer scalable value capture models through advertising and subscription. YouTube dominates its market due to its network effects, while Netflix relies on a concentrated set of content production studios. Other companies like Hulu and Amazon are attempting to differentiate themselves through unique content and vertical integration. Digital firms are challenging traditional providers in most global markets, competing on a data-centric operating model that drives extensive customization and personalization for individual users.

Traditional media companies are merging with content and internet service providers to transform and operate digitally. The innovator in a given industry doesn't always win; having an effective business model is also necessary. Digital firms compete with each other and may emerge as focused competitors or leverage synergies. The winners and level of concentration in each market will be shaped by economies of scale, scope, and learning. The value of connecting to consumers while in transit is high, and automobile companies need a digital, data-centric operating model to exploit opportunities and deliver on-demand services or targeted ads. Car-sharing services and autonomous driving systems offer the best opportunities.

As autonomous driving becomes more prevalent, the car will become a "large smartphone on wheels," leading to a fight for incremental value created and captured. Alphabet, through its mobile business, Android, is well-positioned to shape user behavior and value capture, and subsidiary Waymo is developing a driverless car as a service business. These changes will transform the industry, making transportation less about car ownership and more about convenience and services. The effects of transformation will also upend connected sectors and even governments that rely on automotive taxes.

The automotive industry is moving towards a commoditized software layer, which will erode revenues and margins for traditional auto manufacturers. They have two options: challenge hub firms like Alphabet and Apple or work with them. Some automakers are preparing for a pay-per-use model and investing in driverless research. They may need to invest in digital transformation and new service-based models, and even join forces to aggregate enough scale to be competitive. HERE, a precision map and location service provider, is an interesting player in this space.

HERE is a precision map and location service provider created by a consortium of Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler to counterbalance threats from Google and Apple. The automotive industry is undergoing major changes and transformation due to the new generation of digital operating models. A more concentrated, winner-take-all world is emerging, and different industries are becoming increasingly connected to each other through the digital fabric. A generation of hub firms has emerged, and traditional manufacturers should not underestimate their competitive skill and scale.

Hub firms are able to occupy central positions in the economy and connect traditionally disparate industries, capturing a large share of generated value. They create and control essential connections in key networks, driving increasing returns to scale, scope, and learning. The speed of digital technology's impact is increasing exponentially, with data, analytics, and AI playing a crucial role. These digital superpowers are able to tip the global competitive balance and shape our collective future.

The collision of digital technology with various industries threatens companies like Marriott and Hilton, requiring them to integrate disparate data assets, develop analytics and AI capabilities, and rearchitect their operating models. This impact is felt across the economy and into the social and political system, leading to new threats such as erosion of privacy, cyber threats, disinformation, and economic disparity. The ethics of digital scale, scope, and learning are crucial, especially in matters of public health and children's health.

In 2019, Rep. Adam Schiff sent letters to the CEOs of Google, Facebook, and Amazon regarding the spread of anti-vaccination propaganda on their platforms. False health information is a global issue that raises public health concerns in various regions. The power of these platforms to propagate and target information can also be misused to spread harmful and inaccurate information. The digital operating models prompt new ethical considerations and transform the issues confronted by managers. The learning algorithms and enormous datasets needed for AI can be misused, threatening consumer privacy and putting sensitive information at risk. Business leaders must consider their organizations' responsibilities to customers, employees, shareholders, partners, and communities, given the potential negative effects of their digital platforms.

Digitally enabled businesses pose ethical challenges that go beyond traditional frameworks and guidelines. Challenges include digital amplification, bias, security, control, and inequality, affecting diverse organizations. Leaders must be aware of how digital capabilities can be misused, and every individual must understand and act against potential problems. Digital amplification refers to algorithms that optimize views, purchases, ad clicks, and engagement, potentially reinforcing biases and targeting harmful messages to millions of people. The anti-vaccination movement is an example of a grassroots movement that spreads harmful information.

The anti-vaccine movement has been greatly amplified by social media and technology, leading to echo chamber effects where users only consume content that affirms their beliefs. This has resulted in dangerous outbreaks of diseases like measles and pertussis. Echo chambers are also being used for political, social, and religious purposes. Unlike traditional media, digital networks allow for real-time personalization and active user engagement, which can amplify biases. The impact of digital echo chambers can be harmful, even without systemic intent.

Research shows that digital systems, such as Airbnb and financial services platforms like Kiva, amplify implicit bias and can lead to discrimination against marginalized communities. Even if there is no organized effort to promote discrimination, the amplification potential of digital systems means that many people may be adversely impacted. Algorithmic bias is another ethical challenge, with selection bias and feedback loops leading to flawed AI-driven decisions. For example, Amazon's HR system devalued female job candidates due to biased data inputs.

The article discusses the issue of selection bias in AI, which can occur in various fields such as finance, law enforcement, and facial recognition software. It highlights examples where algorithms have explicitly or implicitly included gender or race in their training data, leading to biased outcomes. The article emphasizes that biased training datasets can cause discrepancies in AI, leading to a lack of diversity in results. Additionally, labeling bias can also result during the exercise of labeling or tagging data, a task that is often crowdsourced.

The article discusses labeling bias in AI, which can occur when data is tagged or labeled by humans, whether through crowdsourcing or specialist labeling. The author cites various studies that highlight biased associations between gender, race, and certain professions or activities. The article also notes how labeling bias can affect medical diagnoses in imaging. The author emphasizes that labeling bias can result in machine-learning software amplifying human biases, leading to a lack of diversity in results.

The text discusses algorithmic bias and its pervasiveness in machine learning. The use of expert-labeled data can introduce bias, and the process of selection and labeling is limited by human knowledge and perspective. Algorithms are designed for a purpose, and this can introduce bias as well. When algorithms make trade-offs in real time, the potential for far-reaching mistakes is high. It is important to understand and work to reduce bias, and managers should carefully choose objectives and datasets when training models.

The text discusses ethical challenges in algorithmic operating models, emphasizing the importance of careful algorithm selection and transparency. It also highlights the growing threat of cyberattacks, including traditional breaches and a new kind of attack that hijacks digital operating models for rogue purposes. The Equifax breach, which exposed sensitive personal data, could have been avoided by better security measures. The scale, frequency, and impact of cyberattacks are daunting and will only increase with the growth of AI and massive datasets.

The Equifax breach was caused by a vulnerability in Apache Struts that allowed for remote code execution, and the attackers were able to access and query over fifty databases undetected for seventy-six days. Equifax delayed announcing the breach and executives sold shares worth $2 million during that time. Other companies such as Microsoft, Marriott, Under Armour, and Sony Pictures have also experienced successful cyber attacks releasing private consumer information, credit card numbers, and patient records.

Companies are increasingly aware of their legal and ethical duty to protect customer information, but cyber attacks continue to be a common challenge. Prevention through investment in security technologies, governance, and training is essential, as is having effective response mechanisms in place. Equifax's breach was due to outdated systems and lack of leadership emphasis on cybersecurity. Companies should invest in upgrading IT systems and building the right culture and capabilities to prevent and detect cyber threats. Delayed communication in the event of a breach can exacerbate damages for both the company and consumers.

Digital security challenges extend beyond traditional cyberattacks and include hijacking digital operating models for rogue purposes. The Christchurch shooting in New Zealand was an example of this, where the shooter streamed the attack on Facebook Live and the video continued to be shared across social media inciting more violence against Muslims. Despite Facebook and YouTube's efforts to remove the video, it continued to be distributed through alterations and variations. Similar evidence of Russian-sponsored digital hijacking to influence political campaigns has also been observed in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Internet Research Agency LLC, a company suspected of being a front for Russian intelligence, allegedly engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes. The group employed hundreds of people in online operations, including generating and buying ads on social media, creating fake accounts and personas, and posting content and videos that were optimized and targeted to promote their agenda. Their efforts reached at least 126 million Facebook users and 2,700 Twitter accounts via 36,000 bots tweeting 1.4 million times. As digital operating models amplify an organization's scale and scope, cybersecurity challenges become increasingly sophisticated and take aim at the foundations of American social and political institutions. Many firms are deploying efforts to fight this new generation of criminals, but as the Equifax example shows, all it takes is one weak link for the problems to begin.

The article discusses the importance of defending against digital perils, and emphasizes the need for individuals, businesses, and government leaders to work together. It highlights the challenges of identifying harmful incidents and the gray areas that exist in digital operating models. The article also addresses the issue of platform control, and how platform companies like Facebook seek to shape and control their ecosystem to prevent harm, but there are concerns about how to properly exercise such control. The article cites the example of Cambridge Analytica's unauthorized harvesting of Facebook user data as a problem that could have been prevented with proper platform control.

The article discusses the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the company harvested Facebook user data without their consent and used it to construct psychological profiles for micro-targeting political campaigns. This was done through an older Facebook application that allowed data harvesting from friends of users who installed the app, and it was used to influence both the Brexit and US presidential campaigns. The scandal raised questions about responsibility and fault, as well as the need for better platform control to prevent such incidents.

Facebook's platform initially allowed developers to introduce tens of thousands of apps to the social network, which expanded with the introduction of additional features such as Facebook Connect and Open Graph. However, problems arose when the platform permitted developers to collect data from users' friends without their knowledge or permission, as seen with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook responded by suspending the company's access to the platform and demanding the deletion of the data, but did not insist on an audit, which may have been difficult to perform.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal highlights the challenges of controlling digital platforms, which are vulnerable to unintended harm due to their openness and connectedness. Platform companies must balance the benefits of open interfaces with the risks of uncontrolled uses. The control challenges are particularly complex for ad platforms that rely on sharing consumer data. The more closed the platform, the lower the risk of unintended harm, but this approach may limit innovation. On the other hand, more open platforms may be more vulnerable to malicious uses. Maintaining a balance between control and openness is a difficult task for platform companies.

Sophisticated ad targeting platforms, using data to aid advertisers, raise concerns about privacy and editorial control over ad appropriateness. Constitutional protections of free speech and censorship further complicate these issues. Companies like Ant Financial amass unprecedented amounts of consumer data, exposing potential harm in case of a cyber breach. The use of APIs by these companies also raises concerns about data exposure.

As digital operating models drive network and learning effects, markets become more concentrated, raising concerns about equity and allocation of value and decision rights. Platform control strategies of companies like Apple, which charges a 30% fee on in-app purchases and restricts apps downloaded from its App Store, are facing antitrust challenges from competitors like Spotify, Netflix, and video game developers. The strong network effects in mobile platforms have led to significant market concentration, giving companies like Apple effective control over access to iPhone customers.

This article discusses how dominant platform firms like Google, Apple, and Amazon can wield excessive market power and shape competition. Although these firms provide ample opportunity for small businesses, they can also compete directly with them. Multihoming and network clustering can work as substantial pushback against dominant behavior, and in some cases, alternative platforms like Walmart's online marketplace can provide important competition. In the case of ride-sharing, widespread multihoming and network clustering have curtailed the ability of firms like Uber and Lyft to raise prices and gather profits, but these firms have worked to reduce multihoming and clustering in their markets.

This article discusses how dominant platform firms like Uber use operational tactics such as app features, pricing discounts, and even buying competitors to control economic networks and harvest profits. The concentration of power in digital firms is already a reality, and regulators are insisting on increased scrutiny. Breaking up these firms makes little sense, and instead, efforts should be focused on fixing and improving digital operating models through effective regulation and community involvement. New leaders must acknowledge new responsibilities and work proactively to solve the new challenges.

The leaders of modern firms must address new ethical challenges with practical solutions. Big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are investing heavily in research to tackle algorithmic bias, fake news, and harmful posts. Even traditional organizations like Equifax and the Democratic National Committee are investing in remedies after being stung by hackers. Navigating the ethics of digital scale, scope, and learning is now a universal management imperative. Companies like Facebook and Equifax occupy central network positions and provide the foundation for networkwide value creation, making them essential to the economy and social system. They must regulate the health of their business networks, like keystone species in biological ecosystems, to maintain ecosystem health through specific, evolved behaviors that have effects much beyond their own species.

The role of a network hub comes with responsibilities, and a keystone strategy aligns a firm's objectives with those of its networks to sustain the health of its business ecosystem. This strategy benefits the long-term performance of the firm and is necessary to preserve a networked business. Big tech companies like Google and Facebook are information fiduciaries and have an obligation to act in a trustworthy manner in the interest of their users by not harming the communities they collect information from.

The article suggests a new "grand bargain" between companies and the federal government, where companies take on the responsibilities of information fiduciaries in exchange for preemption of state and local laws. Hub firms have become stewards of the economy and should pursue actions that enable its long-term sustainability. Many leaders understand this, but more action is needed. Microsoft and Facebook have indicated openness to comprehensive privacy legislation.

The article discusses the emergence of a new type of firm using AI to break down operational constraints and drive new value, growth, and innovation. This new meta is generating enormous opportunity but also presents new challenges and ethical dilemmas. It is compared to the fundamental change in rules during the Industrial Revolution. The next chapter will delve into the long-term patterns and wisdom needed to deal with these challenges.

The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in the means of value creation and capture through increased specialization of work, componentization of organizations, and carefully designed production processes. The shift from handcrafted to mass production methods transformed skills and capabilities, redefined industry boundaries, and had a profound impact on wealth creation and distribution. The Luddite movement emerged in response to the change, protesting against the replacement of traditional textile production methods with coal-powered automated handlooms and high-volume factories. The Industrial Revolution upset the status quo, driving the obsolescence of traditional capabilities and manufacturing strategies, creating new ethical dilemmas, and spurring waves of economic, social, and political change globally.

The Luddite movement emerged in response to the deployment of new machinery and construction of textile factories that replaced traditional textile production methods. The movement, characterized by violent attacks on machines and property, was driven by the concentration of wealth among industrialists and the belief that it came at the expense of the working class. The movement was eventually suppressed by the British army, with several Luddites executed or shipped off to Australia. The Luddite movement represents the kind of unrest that emerges when a new meta emerges, as seen in the revolutionary operating architecture of the modern firm during the Industrial Revolution. This architecture drove increased specialization and rendered traditional artisanal methods of production obsolete.

The emergence of the modern firm during the Industrial Revolution brought deep and pervasive transformations to the world economy, resulting in increased standard of living in Europe and North America, but also wealth disparity and social/political tensions. As we enter the age of AI, change is no longer localized but systemic, affecting all industries globally at the same time. The growth of digital technology continues to improve, with no slowdown in sight, accelerated by advances in software technology, AI and ML algorithms, and computing architecture.

Digital technology and AI are transforming all industries simultaneously, meeting an increasing variety of needs and enabling an incredible variety of use cases, with no sign of slowing down. The transformation provides both opportunities and challenges, as it enhances or automates many operational tasks but also inevitably leads to dislocation as many traditional tasks are digitized, potentially replacing up to half of current work activities.

The impact of machine learning will transform the nature of every job, generating opportunities but also driving widespread dislocation across many occupations. The adoption of AI is transforming the nature of capabilities in a fundamentally different way compared to the Industrial Revolution. AI-powered, network-centric technologies are making capabilities increasingly horizontal and universal, leading to labor augmentation and displacement. The speed and breadth of the impact appear to be many times as great as in the past, and social dislocation is likely to become increasingly challenging.

Competing in an AI-driven world requires a universal set of capabilities, not traditional industry specialization. AI is making vertical, siloed organizations and specialized capabilities less relevant and less competitive. Competitive advantage is shifting towards universal capabilities in data sourcing, processing, analytics, and algorithm development, eroding traditional differentiation strategies and contributing to the gradual demise of traditional specialization. We are moving from an era of core competencies to an age shaped by data and analytics, powered by algorithms and hosted in the computing cloud for anyone to use. This is why companies like Amazon and Tencent can compete in disparate industries.

The digitization of industries is causing traditional industry boundaries to disappear, resulting in industries merging with each other. Primary differentiation is shifting towards a firm's position in the network, accumulation of differentiated data, and deployment of analytics. Digital networks are not constrained in the same ways as traditional organizations and enjoy increasing returns as they connect with other networks. Companies like Alibaba, Amazon, and Tencent are leveraging networks and AI to supercharge their businesses in various markets.

In the age of AI, organizations must leverage customers and data across markets to stay competitive. Companies are finding themselves competing with others from different sectors using different business models. Recombination creates new value, but not all participants benefit equally. Some firms must bridge networks to find new opportunities, while others need to focus on loyalty and differentiation to defend themselves. Digital operating models remove traditional operating constraints and create frictionless impact. A new generation of firms has grown to unprecedented levels of global scale and dominance.

Digital scale is driving a variety of important processes, with information moving instantaneously and frictionlessly to infinite recipients. However, removing friction can lead to instability and difficulty finding equilibrium. Frictionless systems can cause major problems, with content spreading rapidly and morphing to optimize impact and click-through. It is hard to stop a viral signal once it gains momentum, even for organizations that control the key hubs in the network.

Frictionless, AI-driven processes can work as powerful amplifiers of information, opinion, bias, and aggression, with unprecedented reach and impact. Digital scale creates unprecedented valuation multiples and scalability, but also new leadership and governance challenges. Concentration and inequality are likely to get worse due to the dynamics of digital networks, leading to the concentration of power and value. Hub firms like Google and Facebook connect consumers, firms, and industries, gaining important advantages in linking sectors of the economy.

The acceleration of digital connectivity has led to the consolidation of industries around a few hubs, which has increased inequality and frustration, similar to reactions seen during the Industrial Revolution. The digitization of the economy appears to have passed an inflection point, and the impact of the digital firm is amplifying, leading to a drop in public trust and cohesion. Significant signs of fracture have been apparent for years, suggesting that we may have been too smitten with the rise of the industrial firm.

The challenges posed by unconstrained digital operating models are becoming clear, from economic disparities to political manipulation and cyber warfare. These vulnerabilities require new sensitivities and a broader range of managerial and policy considerations. Addressing the resulting redistribution of income, influence, and power will require a focus on stakeholders beyond shareholders and consideration of solutions like a universal basic income.

The decisions of leaders have a significant impact on society, and Lord Byron's speech suggests that addressing grievances and finding solutions can restore order. The modern corporation and the age of AI present new challenges that require wisdom and managerial expertise. However, there is a shortage of managerial wisdom, and the evolving concept of the firm and advancements in technology require new approaches. The age of AI mandates a need for leaders to find solutions to these challenges.

Leaders need to find better ways to manage the assets and capabilities of increasingly digital organizations, across various types of firms and communities. Transformation is necessary for all organizations to adapt to the new operating model, and resources are available to help with deployment. However, the most challenging work involves changing the organization and building the right skills, capabilities, and culture to drive digital transformation. The text highlights critical transformation steps and emphasizes the importance of motivating and grooming leaders to do this work.

The speed of change across all industries requires managerial action, but developing the wisdom to act is a leadership challenge. Traditional firms often struggle with transformation, setting up pilots but failing to commit to the real thing. Failures arise when managers cannot diagnose industry shifts or challenge the status quo. Even when committed and resourced, significant headwinds can slow progress, as seen with General Electric's struggles with its GE Digital unit.

The success of enterprise transformation requires committed leadership, bridging gaps and making necessary changes. Leaders must inspire ongoing commitment, even if they spend billions of dollars. Transformation must align the fleet, but not force them into a linear speed that can be disrupted. The leadership challenge applies to all companies, including digital organizations that must transform to build a foundation of safety, security, and sustainability in their business.

The concept of leadership should not be limited to the top of an organization and everyone should be inspired to contribute. The best managers need to retool and learn both the foundational knowledge behind AI and the ways that technology can be effectively deployed in their organizations. Qualifications for leaders should start with an understanding of the digital systems they are creating and leading, and with a full appreciation of the organizational, ethical, economic, and political consequences of getting these systems wrong. Good leaders of digital firms must also understand the human side and master the critical issues that inevitably come up as workers interact with increasingly digital operating models.

Leaders need to have a well-rounded understanding of both technology and human nature. The emergence of AI has created vast entrepreneurial opportunities across various industries, from content creation to healthcare improvement. Many of the challenges in AI also provide opportunities for innovation and technological breakthroughs. Innovation costs have dropped significantly, making it more accessible to anyone. However, deeper analysis is necessary to evaluate a venture's business model and competitive implications.

The article discusses how Uber and other ride-sharing companies provide increased consumer surplus and employment flexibility, but their business model may not make money and could potentially cause environmental and traffic externalities. The article suggests that digital firms need to consider the social and ethical implications of their business and operating models to sustain their success and improve the communities around them. Blockchain technology may offer a solution to problems caused by digitization and AI.

The article discusses the need for blockchain-based business models to reflect new thinking in order to achieve sustainable impact beyond financial speculation. Business model innovation and entrepreneurship will be important for the success of each blockchain technology, and leaders will need to deal with continuous change and frequent collisions in the markets they compete in. Regulators are racing to catch up with technology and will increasingly shape spaces such as traffic safety and racial bias as the impact of AI continues to increase.



 Europe's GDPR introduced fundamental data protection principles to give individuals some ownership over their data and put in place strict controls. However, there are concerns that large tech companies will benefit the most from GDPR, raising costs for startups and reinforcing their domination. Antitrust efforts have targeted major companies like Microsoft and Google, with fines imposed for anticompetitive behavior. It is uncertain whether fines are the most effective remedy for an economy with new kinds of deep-rooted issues. Crafting impactful remedies for violations in privacy and antitrust is a crucial and challenging issue that requires extensive debate. Hub companies are recognizing the need to work with governments to shape regulations and policy.



 Tech firms are developing capabilities to shape the outcome of regulations, but collaboration between government regulators and companies is important to address difficult issues in the digital economy such as inequality, privacy, and bias. Collaborative structures and sustained expert involvement may be needed to monitor situations, motivate changes, and drive regulatory innovation. Communities are an important complement to regulation, as seen in the development and evolution of the Linux operating system by a global community of engineers with clear governance and accountability.

Open source software guarantees that any product derivative will be free. It has gained global popularity, powering many products like Linux, Apache, Firefox, MySQL, and TensorFlow. Craigslist and Wikipedia are examples of open source success beyond software infrastructure, with Wikipedia being the most commonly used encyclopedia worldwide. Its governance resembles that of many open source projects with clear organization and accountability.

Wikipedia's open and transparent editing process has consistently avoided inaccuracy and bias, as established by research studies. The community-based feedback system allows for corrections and improvements over time, with diverse political views producing higher quality content. The potential for communities to solve problems created by digital operating models is enormous, with organizations modeled after the open source community playing a critical role in solving digital economy and societal problems such as algorithmic bias and fake news. Examples of successful open source projects include Linux and TensorFlow.

The text discusses the importance of community efforts in creating and maintaining software products and technologies, and how this model can be emulated in other areas such as content and AI research. The author emphasizes the need to safeguard and improve the crucial leadership roles played by communities in shaping policies and regulations. Increasing investments in shaping crowds and innovation communities with fair and dynamic governance systems can drive monitoring, instant response, and long-term improvements. Ultimately, communities can dramatically improve and extend the impact of regulatory and policy-making bodies. The text also emphasizes the need for a new kind of collective wisdom to understand the impact of digital transformation and the importance of interdependencies.

The text discusses how the collective dynamics of AI-enabled social and economic networks change the perspective on management and leadership, and the need to pay more attention to their impact beyond the single firm to the broader community. Digital firms increasingly shape our global economy and their management will be held accountable to a different standard. The consequences on the broader community should be considered before making critical business decisions. The text cites examples of sudden, collective failure such as fake news and privacy crises, data breaches, and the responsibility of Ant Financials investment accounts for a huge portion of the Chinese population.

The success of individual firms is interconnected with the health of their ecosystems and the collective improvement of their systems. Rather than solely focusing on competition, firms should strive for collaboration and establish common principles. Communities, regulators, and organizations such as the Partnership on AI can help in developing open digital technologies and platforms. A philosophical shift is necessary for individual firms to understand their responsibility in shaping their networked competitive settings. The burden of this responsibility falls on network hubs such as Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, Alibaba, Amazon, and others.

Digital networks and AI have fundamentally transformed the nature of firms, creating both enormous opportunity and extraordinary turbulence. Leading through these changes requires a new kind of managerial wisdom. Organizations like Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent, and Facebook have a crucial leadership responsibility in shaping their ecosystems. The challenges cannot be solved by technology alone, and management is still necessary. The frameworks presented in this book can inform the debates on these crucial dynamics and shape the thinking of a generation of leaders.
